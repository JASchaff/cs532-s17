<p><strong>Trek Domane S 6 Disc</strong></p>
<p>The Trek Domane S 6 Disc might look like most other disc-equipped road bikes, but the company’s IsoSpeed decoupler system sets it apart from that crowd. IsoSpeed effectively separates the front and rear triangles of the bike by adding a pivot where the seatstays meet the seat tube, providing a small degree of rear-end flex to minimize road chatter and reduce rider fatigue. There’s also a rocker cup in the head tube to allow fore-and-aft flex at the front. Trek has paired this technology with a full Shimano Ultegra 11-speed mechanical drivetrain, hydraulic disc brakes and a healthy dose of Bontrager components for a bike that is ready to tackle the roughest roads around.

<p><strong>Specialized Roubaix Expert UDi2</strong></p>
<p class="p1">The Roubaix Expert UDi2 takes its name from the famous Paris-Roubaix race in Northern France, which is marked by long and exceedingly rough cobblestone sectors. The bike is designed to handle these types of torturous roads and brings with it the technology to do so. Specialized worked with McLaren Applied Technologies to develop the Future Shock suspension, which provides 20 mm of adjustable travel in the steering tube to smooth out rough roads. The spec on the bike is excellent: a full Shimano Ultegra Di2 11-speed electronic drivetrain, including crankset, with Specialized parts at the contact points and DT R460 disc wheels.

<p><strong>Cervelo C3 Ultagra 6800</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Cervélo has been carving out a name for itself on the pro circuit for years now. The Canadian-born brand definitely attracts a loyal following. The C3 may be the company’s more “value-conscious” model of endurance bike, but that doesn’t mean it is any less capable than the top model. The C3 Ultegra 6800 combines a full carbon frame and fork, a mix of Ultegra 11-speed mechanical drivetrain parts, hydraulic disc brakes, Rotor cranks, FSA components at the contact points and Hed Ardennes Plus GP Disc wheels into a well-rounded package that will give you the boutique-brand cachet and performance without putting you in the poor house.

<p><strong>Felt VR2</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Felt launched its new VR line this past August, adding another set of endurance bikes to complement its Z line. The VR2 is the top model in the line. The full carbon frame sports a Shimano Ultegra Di2 drivetrain, an FSA SL-K crankset and Mavic Ksyrium Elite Disc Allroad wheelset. Cockpit parts are from 3T; the saddle is from Prologo. Shimano calipers and Ice Technology rotors – 160 mm in front, 140 mm at the back – modulate your speed. When you hit a tough climb, you’ll really like the super-compact 46/30-tooth gearing matched to the 11–32 tooth cassette. (<a href="http://feltbicycles.com">feltbicycles.com</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Garneau Gennix D1 Elite</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Garneau is a familiar name to generations of Canadian cyclists. The Gennix D1 Elite is the company’s second-tier endurance road bike. The 52/36-tooth crankset, however, seems to be aimed more toward road racing than endurance riding. The bike combines the benefits of hydraulic disc brakes with the cost savings of a mechanical drivetrain. The bike has been spec’d with full Shimano Ultegra components. The bar and stem are from 3T, and are paired with a Fizik saddle. The frame has enough clearance to let you run 28c tires on the Shimano RX31 disc wheels. Sizes run from extra small to extra, extra large, so there’s likely a Gennix for everyone out there. (<a href="http://garneau.com">garneau.com</a>)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian road cyclist Matteo Dal-Cin won a modified first stage at the Tour of the Gila yesterday. Del-Cin was the first of seven Rally Cycling teammates to finish in the top ten, the team taking a firm hold of the standings to kick off the five stage race.</p>
<p>“I felt excellent today,” said Dal-Cin. “We had four or five guys right up there so when I went, they sat up, and I got a pretty healthy gap straight away. I took a look back and could see our guys all over the front of the peloton, so I just went for it!”</p>
<p>Fellow Canadians and Rally Cycling teammates Rob Britton Adan de Vos finished fourth and fifth respectively.</p>
<p>The stage wound through the host town of Silver City before heading North into the Gila National Forest to finish 143kms later, at Whitewater Mesa. Flood damage to the road leading to the traditional Mogollon forced organizers to devise a reroute that still provided an excellent climbing challenge.</p>
<p>Following the intermediate sprint, Canadian Marc-Antoine Nadon, riding for H&amp;R Block launched an attack and was joined out front by Michael Burleigh and Chad Beyer of Canyon Bicycles. The three stayed out front, building a lead to nearly six minutes. Nadon won the second intermediate sprint before dropping away from the break, and getting caught up by the peloton.</p>
<p>With 10km remaining, the main group had pulled in the leaders and teams jockeyed for position heading into the 13 percent grade heading into the finish. It was during all of this action that Dal-Cin found a winning opportunity, taking the stage victory and leader’s jersey to close out his day.</p>

<p>Strong headwinds played into the women’s stage yesterday, keeping the group together for most of the route. During the first 30kms Tibco and United Healthcare teams pushed the pace on the way to the first intermediate sprint, before regrouping in the heavy winds. Canadian Jamie Gilgen of Rise Racing pushed free for a small lead, winning the second sprint.</p>
<p>Regrouping again due to wind, the women’s field raced towards the finish, until Katie Hall struck out alone, building a 10 second lead over the field in the final 5kms, winning the stage. Hall’s United Healthcare teammate Ruth Winder finished second, followed by Canadian Sara Bergen of Rally Cycling.</p>

<p>An Australian triathlete was sprayed in the face with industrial fluid by an angry motorist. She was out on a training ride this past Sunday morning.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://thewest.com.au/news/wa/triathlete-anthea-stacey-sprayed-with-chemical-by-angry-motorist-ng-b88446232z" target="_blank"><em>The West Australian</em></a>, Anthea Stacey, 23, was out riding with a friend when a car approached her from behind, sounded a horn with the window down, swerved within centimetres of the two riders and sprayed the chemicals in her face.</p>
<p>She was left momentarily blind and unable to breathe.</p>
<p>“He swerved in close to me and sprayed. It shocked me, I couldn’t breathe,” she said.</p>
<p>Another cyclist’s camera captured a similar event just up the road, with another group of cyclists.</p>
<p>Stacey says she has been riding in Western Australia for eight years and has observed hostile drivers in the past.</p>
<p>“You are always getting drivers who will give you an aggressive toot and will drive too close, people yelling at you,” she said. “It’s the mentality. We are not out there to do harm but they just can’t stand it. It can be quite scary because if you flinch you can come off.”</p>
<p>Stacey has reported the event to the police but charges have yet to be laid.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So far Anna van der Breggen has ruled the women&#8217;s Ardennes Week with two WorldTour wins on the trot, adding her third consecutive La Fleche Wallonne Feminine title to her Amstel Gold Race victory over the weekend. In Wednesday&#8217;s men&#8217;s race the incredible season of Alejandro Valverde continues as he wins his fourth Walloon Arrow in a row and fifth in all.</p>
<p><strong>The Women&#8217;s Race</strong><br />
The women faced 120-km and seven climbs, including two trips up the Mur de Huy, one of which was to the finish line.</p>

Climb 1, Cote d&#8217;Ereffe came at the 16-km mark and it was there that the second effort to scamper away was neutralized. Crosswinds and a high pace had already strung the pack out with a few splits. A foursome then dashed away and had a minute&#8217;s gap by kilometre 29. </p>
<p>Behind the break winds were playing havoc with the peloton and a crash at kilometre 48 added to the chaos. </p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
Boels-Dolmans and then Sunweb provided the chase engines. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FWwomen?src=hash">#FWwomen</a> The chase is on at the front of the race, before the 2nd climb of the day @ KM 76.

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
After the second climb, the Cote d&#8217;Amay, only two riders remained in the escape and they had 37-seconds over the bunch. South African Ashleigh Moolman then attacked from the chase to join Cervelo-Bigla teammate Alison Dragoo in the escape. </p>
<p>As soon as the new formation was hauled back with 22-km to go, another Cervelo rider, Dane Marie Vilmann stole away with Ukrainian Tetyana Riabchenko of Lensworld-Kuota. They made it to the top of the second ascent of Cote d&#8217;Ereffe with a 32-second lead. Behind them the peloton shed rider after rider.<br />
<strong><br />
Niewiadoma Kicks It Off</strong></p>
<p>A surge by Pole Katarzyna Niewiadoma on the Cote de Cherave with 7-km remaining dropped a lot of favourites. Niewiadoma flew past the fugitives. Elizabeth Deignan reached the WM3 rider out front. Wilmann, Moolman and Deignan&#8217;s teammate Van der Breggen chased hard. Only van der Breggen made it over before the final Huy showdown. </p>
<p>Van der Breggen immediately attacked on the base of the Huy. There was no touching the Olympic and European champion. Boels-Dolmans took the one-two as Deignan came runner up, her third WorldTour podium. Niewiadoma&#8217;s third also gave her three WorldTour podiums this year and five top-10&#8217;s. Coryn Rivera&#8217;s seventh place was good enough to keep her in the WorldTour lead. </p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
Leah Kirchmann was the top Canadian in 31st place, +4:06 of van der Breggen.</p>
<p><strong>The Men&#8217;s Race</strong><br />
One of the shorter WorldTour one-day races of the year, the chaps had just over 200-km and 8-climbs to negotiate, including three ascents of the Mur. Just the women&#8217;s course, the final haul up the Mur would be to the finish line.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550"><p lang="ro" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FlecheWallonne?src=hash">#FlecheWallonne</a> Two local laps of 29 km at the end, including Côte d&#39;Ereffe, Côte de Cherave and Mur de Huy (1.3 km and 9.6 % average). <a href="https://t.co/NTvHopasl6">pic.twitter.com/NTvHopasl6</a></p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
Soon after the gun in Binche, two moves coalesced to form a six-man breakaway that had a four minute lead after 30-km of racing. There were no climbs in the first 3/5 of the course and by the first ascent, the Côte d&#8217;Amay at the 127-km point, the sextet had a 3:30 lead. Orica-Scott and Movistar did much of the pacemaking. </p>
<p>The race would enter the first of two clockwise laps via the first passage of the Mur. Dan Pearson of Aqua Blue Sport was one of the two escapees who could stay with their breakmates after Mur One. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here is Dan Pearson in the break on the Mur de Huy for the first time. 1&#39;35&quot; the gap. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FlecheWallonne?src=hash">#FlecheWallonne</a> <a href="https://t.co/aeiD9aI6Gg">pic.twitter.com/aeiD9aI6Gg</a></p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
On the Côte d&#8217;Ereffe with 46-km to go BMC&#8217;s Alessandro De Marchi (Italy) skipped away from the peloton to make things difficult for Movistar. Although the race all came together with 34-km remaining, De Marchi insisted on scooting away again, this time on the Côte de Cherave. He hit the second passage of the Mur with a gap that was 20-seconds at climb&#8217;s peak.</p>
<p>Bob Jungels (Luxembourg/Quick Step) attacked on the Mur&#8217;s downhill, linking up with De Marchi. They had a 30-second gap with 25-km to go. The duo maintained its gap over the second passage of the d&#8217;Ereffe. Jungels left his Italian partner behind with 12-km to go. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Jungels va-t-il le faire ? / Will Jungels make it? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FlecheWallonne?src=hash">#FlecheWallonne</a> <a href="https://t.co/L2A0gSrInm">pic.twitter.com/L2A0gSrInm</a></p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
Jungels&#8217; gap grew. The peloton yanked back De Marchi on the Cherave.  Sky in general and Bora-Hansgrohe&#8217;s Rafal Majka (Poland) in particular led up the Cherave, where Jungels&#8217; lead shrank back to 30-seconds. </p>
<p><strong>The Mur</strong></p>
<p>The peloton, now radically streamlined, had Cannondale on its pointy end as the Mur loomed. At the red flag, the 20% section on the climb still to come, Jungels had 10-seconds, but Sky swept him up with 600-metres to go.</p>
<p>It was hard riding in the final half-kilometres. Little David Gaudu (France/FDJ) tried a sharp dig but he was pulled back. With 175-metres remaining Valverde just rode away from everyone. He had plenty of time to fling an imaginary arrow and raise a handful of digits.</p>

Dan Martin (Ireland/Quick Step) was runner-up and BMC&#8217;s Dylan Teuns an impressive third. </p>
<p>Valverde adds the one-day WorldTour race to his two 2017 WorldTour stage race victories at the Volta a Ciclista Catalunya and the Pais Vasco. He also took victory at the Ruta Del Sol and Costa Calida races. </p>
<p>Michael Woods was prominent on the Mur and his 11th place is one spot higher than last season. </p>
<p>Ardennes Week concludes Sunday with the fourth Monument of the WorldTour season and the eighth race of the Women&#8217;s WorldTour, Liege-Bastogne-Liege. </p>

<p>Albert Hofmann, a Swiss chemist, rode home from the Sandoz lab at which he worked on April 19, 1943. His lab assistant rode with him. As they pedalled along, Hofmann began to feel bad. &#8220;My condition began to assume threatening forms,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Everything in my field of vision wavered and was distorted as if seen in a curved mirror.&#8221; On that day, Hofmann became the first person to trip on LSD, lysergic acid diethylamide. Since that trip involved a jaunt on a bike, the day is commemorated as Bicycle Day.</p>
<p>Hofmann had first synthesized the drug in 1938 with a plan to use it as a circulatory and respiratory stimulant, but it didn&#8217;t seem to gain any traction at the lab. Still, Hofmann remained curious about the properties of LSD. On April 16, 1943, he synthesized LSD once again. This time, he felt a little funny. &#8220;I was forced to interrupt my work in the laboratory in the middle of the afternoon and proceed home, being affected by a remarkable restlessness, combined with a slight dizziness,&#8221; he wrote in <a href="https://www.hallucinogens.org/hofmann/child1.htm" target="_blank"><em>LSD: My Problem Child</em></a>. &#8220;At home, I lay down and sank into a not unpleasant intoxicated-like condition, characterized by an extremely stimulated imagination. In a dreamlike state, with eyes closed (I found the daylight to be unpleasantly glaring), I perceived an uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colours. After some two hours this condition faded away.&#8221; Three days later, he experimented on himself, taking a high—for LSD—dose of 250 micrograms.</p>
<h3>Very Little to Do with the Bike</h3>
<p>In the his laboratory journal, Hofmann wrote, &#8220;Home by bicycle. From 18:00- ca.20:00 most severe crisis.&#8221; In his book, he added that he and his lab assistant travelled by bike because of wartime restrictions on cars. When the trip was going badly, he wrote, &#8220;I also had the sensation of being unable to move from the spot. Nevertheless, my assistant later told me that we had travelled very rapidly.&#8221; For a post-ride drink, Hofmann wanted milk, which, for some reason, he thought would work as an antidote. He ended up drinking about 2 l of milk. And his trip got worse.</p>
<p>In Hofmann&#8217;s account of that first experiment, the bike seems to play a minor role, possibly on par with the milk. Yet, the bicycle has become emblematic of the first trip. Maybe it&#8217;s simply the idea of travel—the bike as means of transportation, the drug as means for a psychedelic journey—that led to the name Bicycle Day. It&#8217;s also a bit odd that psychedelic enthusiasts would be keen on the bike ride as the pedal home seemed to be quite a drag.</p>
<h3>LSD and Performance</h3>
<p>During that first physical activity on acid, Hofmann didn&#8217;t feel as if he was moving at all, yet his partner said they moved at a good clip. That hardly sounds like an endorsement for riding on acid. Still, writer, psychedelic enthusiast and paraglider James Oroc made <a href="https://www.maps.org/news-letters/v21n1/v21n1-25to29.pdf" target="_blank">some pretty large performance claims for LSD in a paper for the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies</a>. &#8220;According to the combined reports of 40 years of use by the extreme sports underground, LSD can increase your reflex time to lightning speed, improve your balance to the point of perfection, increase your concentration until you experience &#8216;tunnel vision,&#8217; and make you impervious to weakness or pain. LSD&#8217;s effects in these regards amongst the extreme-sport community are in fact legendary, universal, and without dispute,&#8221; he wrote. He didn&#8217;t cite any sources in that paper.</p>
<p>As for bikes, Oroc mentions mountain bikers a few times. &#8220;I also have no doubt that someone rides Slickrock in Moab on mushrooms or acid probably every single day,&#8221; he wrote. The only &#8220;well-documented&#8221; acid-fuelled athletic performance Oroc cites is that of Doc Ellis. The pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates threw a no-hitter on June 12, 1970. Later, Ellis claimed he threw the &#8220;no-no&#8221; on LSD. There are, however, <a href="http://www.snopes.com/sports/baseball/ellis.asp" target="_blank">still many uncertainties surrounding Ellis&#8217;s claim</a>.</p>
<p>Recently, LSD has piqued the interest of Silicon Valley types. Microdoses of the drug, these new enthusiasts say, <a href="http://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/money/a51756/lsd-microdosing/">can improve your concentration, your creativity, your ability to work long hours and your mood</a>.</p>
<p>In Canada, LSD is listed as a Schedule III drug under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. Possession, trafficking and manufacturing of Hofmann&#8217;s drug are all offences under the act.</p>

<p>The feature, which has been part of the web-based platform since early 2014. A club admin can create an event, choose a route, set a meeting place and provide more information about the ride. Club members can then RSVP. Now, you don&#8217;t need to log into a browser to use these features. They&#8217;re in the app.</p>
<p>“Bringing our Club Events feature to mobile is another way we’re continuing to help our community of athletes engage with one another,” said Will Lee, product manager at Strava. “From talking to club admins, we learned that they were looking for an easier way to plan group activities with members, especially on mobile. Club events on mobile allow athletes in a club to organize a real-world activity quickly. Bringing Club Events to mobile is our latest step to help build thriving communities on Strava.”</p>

The point of contact between the bike and the earth’s surface is extremely important for cyclists in all disciplines, good tires goes a long way. The tire you choose between you and the trail or road surface will impact comfort and performance. Riders, especially those focused on gaining every advantage they can get, are looking for tires with a balance of low rolling resistance, lightweight, and the right traction all while maintaining excellent puncture resistance and comfort. In labs and factories, rubber for cyclists is being refined to offer up every advantage possible.</p>
<h4>Designing the right tire for every rider</h4>
<p>“The most important question we ask ourselves is who will be the end user,” explained Jay Drunasky a senior engineer with Kenda Tire. “If it’s a high-end road tire there will be compromises with thread puncture resistance or sidewall puncture resistance but it will have excellent rolling resistance and weight,” he said.</p>

<p>The challenges of dialing in a tire for new and emerging trends keeps Kenda’s engineers constantly refining and testing new designs. “A lot of my riding friends are pretty well educated and it’s fun to look at new trends. Road tires are a little bit easier because the changes are quite small. If we are going from 25c to 30c it doesn’t require a huge degree of re-imaging to make a new tire,” Drunasky explained. “The big size range in mountain bike tires is quite difficult with the tread patterns requiring much more testing.” <a href="http://cyclingmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/troupe-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26282" src="http://cyclingmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/troupe-1.jpg" alt="troupe-1" width="1200" height="900" srcset="http://cyclingmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/troupe-1.jpg 1200w, http://cyclingmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/troupe-1-300x225.jpg 300w, http://cyclingmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/troupe-1-768x576.jpg 768w, http://cyclingmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/troupe-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://cyclingmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/troupe-1-160x120.jpg 160w, http://cyclingmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/troupe-1-320x240.jpg 320w, http://cyclingmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/troupe-1-480x360.jpg 480w, http://cyclingmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/troupe-1-640x480.jpg 640w, http://cyclingmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/troupe-1-960x720.jpg 960w, http://cyclingmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/troupe-1-1120x840.jpg 1120w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></p>
<p>The process of designing a new trail tire often begins with consulting the top riders who will be competing on them. “Generally we will get the pros involved fairly early on in the project. We do benchmark testing and get them up to speed with the goals,” he explained about the working with the Polygon UR downhill team who get very involved with new projects. “They may get involved in tread pattern and we work with them to get initial feedback. Once the tire is ready if we test it with our pro athletes and they like it, it is sure to be a good tire,” Drunasky said about the trust Kenda have in their pro athletes.</p>
<p>Designing most tires involves extensive testing especially against in class competitors. Once the project goals are defined, Drunasky and Kenda’s other engineers including the ones who are working with the compounds and materials will match the right construction with the tires designated end use.</p>

<h4>The parts of a good cycling tire</h4>
<p>“We have spreadsheets of test data on each compound and how they perform, their hardness, rolling resistance and traction,” Drunasky said. A more puncture resistant tire will use thicker materials for the side walls while a supple race tire will use a higher grade tread compound but feature slightly less puncture resistance.</p>
<p><a href="http://cyclingmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/troupe-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26283" src="http://cyclingmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/troupe-3.jpg" alt="Kenda" width="1200" height="900" srcset="http://cyclingmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/troupe-3.jpg 1200w, http://cyclingmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/troupe-3-300x225.jpg 300w, http://cyclingmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/troupe-3-768x576.jpg 768w, http://cyclingmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/troupe-3-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://cyclingmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/troupe-3-160x120.jpg 160w, http://cyclingmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/troupe-3-320x240.jpg 320w, http://cyclingmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/troupe-3-480x360.jpg 480w, http://cyclingmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/troupe-3-640x480.jpg 640w, http://cyclingmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/troupe-3-960x720.jpg 960w, http://cyclingmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/troupe-3-1120x840.jpg 1120w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></p>
<p>“We have a huge bank of test data for each compound and how they perform. With our performance goals in mind we choose the materials that will give us the right rolling resistance, traction and puncture protection at our target price point,” he said. Kenda has data on how each material performs on its own but then they go through the testing process with a newly constructed tire to see how it performs as a single unit. With mountain bike tires, once a tread pattern is developed, Kenda test different compounds and materials to find the design that will offer the best performance in all the key areas.</p>

<p>A fast rolling compound will cost more due to higher quality polymers and materials as will a higher thread count fabric. Flat resistant materials tend to be stiffer and heavier so they tend not to be as heavily used on designs that prioritize light weight and suppleness. The casing is the backbone of a tire. For additional flat protection, other fabrics are often added, some stiffer, lighter or more flexible depending on the end goal. Lightweight fabrics won’t affect the rolling speed as much while something stiffer will affect rolling resistance though have higher flat protection.</p>
<h4>Rolling resistance</h4>
<p>After wind resistance, rolling resistance is the second largest contributor to drag on a cyclist. Thick, tough tires will feel slower than supple tires made from high-grade compounds.  A wider tire often is beneficial to rolling resistance. Kenda do their rolling resistance testing on a large drum that helps them measure the difference in wattage directly and then measurements are done on the road.</p>

<p>Companies have various compounds they use to make the tread of their tires. These compounds are made by mixing polymers from synthetic and organic sources.</p>
<p>Drunasky said rolling resistance is one of the most important factors Kenda take into consideration designing their tires. The tire casings which can range from supple to hard, play a big role in determining the rolling resistance of the tire. Generally, high threads per inch (TPI) count indicates a more supple tire. A higher number indicates the casing threads are closer together and thus thinner though not all companies count TPI in the same way.</p>
<p>Another major factor is tire pressure. “Most advanced riders have a good understanding of the tire pressure that works for them. Many riders play around with their tire pressure to find the traction, rolling resistance, and comfort that suits their needs. The fastest rolling is a higher pressure,” Drunasky explained. “Dropping pressure can improve tire grip and it’s all highly dependent on the rider.” The road surface will also play a big factor in the right tire pressure with more traction necessary to navigate coarse roads and gravel.</p>

<p>Mountain biking is a bit more complicated with riders who are smoother over technical features able to ride lower pressures and thus be able to get a bit more traction out of a tire than those who are, as Drunasky put it, “bashing into everything.” With downhill and xc tires another factor is how closely the knobs are to each other in designed. A hard pack race tire can have more closely backed knobs for faster riding while a tire designed to shed mud will have a higher rolling resistance.</p>
<h4>Roll with the right tire</h4>
<p>The benefits of having the right tire are measurable. “Going from a very cheap tire to an optimized tire, just in rolling resistance alone can be double, a very cheap road tire will require a lot more watts to push at the same speed,” said Drunasky.</p>

<p>While riders really focused on performance have educated themselves about rolling resistance and weighed their needs and budget, Drunasky said notice riders could benefit from getting more information before investing in a new set of tires. It could not only result in choosing a more suitable tire for their riding purpose but also give them more confidence on the riding surfaces they most frequently tackle.</p>

<p>Queen&#8217;s were the early leaders of the series with dominating results in the Men&#8217;s A team time trials and consistently solid performances in the road races across the men and women&#8217;s categories. The Canadian universities accumulate points in the standings but are not eligible for taking conference titles or the USA Cycling collegiate road national championships.</p>
<p>The ECCC has categories for all racers starting with intro categories for first-time racers through to top level riders competing in A. Notable pro&#8217;s who raced in the ECCC include American Ted King who raced for Middlebury College and Megan Guarnier who won the inaugural edition of the Women&#8217;s WorldTour last year.</p>

<p>The series is comprised of five rounds with the series concluding next weekend with the conference champions.

The flashy neon blue frame has a paint job reminiscent of the Maserati&#8217;s, Ferrari&#8217;s and Alfa Romeo&#8217;s their partner Italian car design firm Pininfarina, works on.</p>

<p>The bike has the aerodynamic features we&#8217;ve come to expect from a top-end race bike. Additionally, the SK—which stands for Super King— Pininfarina has a tapered head tube, lowered seatstays and wide tubes for increased stiffness. The frame has routing for mechanical or electronic shifting.</p>

<p>Last year, the DMBA had a spring demo and the demo festival builds off last year’s event which they say attracted over 1,000 participants. This year activities planned include pancakes in the forest a long-standing tradition that attracts families to ride with their children in the morning, try new bikes and of course eat pancakes.</p>
<p>The DMBA will host kids rides, skill sessions and Joyride 150 will set up a skills park with audience participation competitions and prizes drawn throughout the day.</p>
<p>There will be an exhibition area set up where manufacturers, distributors and bike shops will showcase their products and services. There will also be music courtesy of RedBull and an event MC. There will be a variety of food options from local businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited that Durham Mountain Bike Association in partnership with our sponsors and the community of Uxbridge have joined in launching this event,” said John Fisher, president of DMBA. &#8220;More and more Canadians are enjoying the vast network of trails across our province. We want to shine a spotlight on the trails of Uxbridge and provide a fun event for all mountain bikers to try exciting new products and meet the companies that fuel our passion.”</p>
