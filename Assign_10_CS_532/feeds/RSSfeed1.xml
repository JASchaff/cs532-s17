He is motivated by a desire to help solve the cancer problem, and believes that if he can do this, almost anyone can! As he says, he has noticed that it is your will, not your body type, that gets you through marathon attempts. I spoke with Ken about his motivation, his training, and his experiences of preparing for his very first Ride to Conquer Cancer.</p>

They are cordless (Bluetooth) headphones that conduct sound to you via vibrations on your cheekbones, instead of by plugging up your ears. This makes these headphones ideal for people listening to music while vulnerable to traffic, such as pedestrians and cyclists. The new CORDLESS Trekz Titanium Bluetooth open ear bone conduction earphones are a great idea, and have been very well designed. This review will help you decide if you want to try this new technology.</p>

Despite strong opposition from men, women cycled on, and the bicycle became an instrument of change that subverted the status quo and became a powerful symbol of women's emancipation. In this Guest Post, Andrew McLaughlin tells us all about the extraordinary role played by bicycles in women's emancipation.</p>

The Garmin Edge 1000 is on sale right now (20 April 2017), discounted by $100. This hardly ever happens, so if you are interested in getting one for your spring/summer training, grab it while it lasts! The Garmin Edge 1000 is best suited for serious or competitive cyclists who wish to take their cycling skills and performance to a whole new level. </p>

In this book, Walker shows the close relationship between infrastructure and the way people get about. Therefore, to create mass cycling you need to create a conducive built environment. Walker discusses bike helmets and high visibility clothing; the misuse of the word accident; roadside intimidation; cycling activism; older people and cycling; business objections to cycling; bike share programs; and the role played by La Monde à Bicyclette and Vélo Quebec in the transformation of Montreal.</p>

In this book, Walker shows the close relationship between infrastructure and the way people get about. Therefore, to create mass cycling you need to create a conducive built environment. The way to do this is in fact already well known – only the political will is lacking. So what’s the secret? Basically, bikes must be kept separate from motor traffic on busy roads, and the separation must be physical. “A bicycle way that is not safe for an eight-year-old is not a bicycle way.” </p>
