				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like all adventures, bicycle travel’s basic requirement is one of the modern world’s most scarce and valuable resources: <i>time</i>. Create time for a bicycle journey and you have already set the stage for a unique and unforgettable experience.</p>
<p>We all know what must happen for time to be created: it must be reclaimed from other parts of our lives. Work is the biggest time-eater of all, of course. So some of us will use our annual leave to get our adventure fix, some of us will arrange a sabbatical, some of us will quit our jobs altogether, and a few of us won’t have a job to quit in the first place. But all of us can make time for a bike trip if we choose to. This, really, is the biggest part of ‘how’ to do a bike trip: simply make time for one. If all it amounts to is blocking out a few weekends for two-wheeled adventures close to home, there’s nothing wrong with that. And if those adventures spark off a bigger dream, there’ll be a way to make it happen.</p>
<p>It’s natural to assume that equipment has a large part to play in how cycle touring works. And you do need, at the very least, a bicycle that fits you well enough that you don’t end up crippled at the end of a day’s riding. Camping gear may expand your overnighting options. Cooking gear may make life on the road more homely and reduce long-term costs. Technical clothing may help in challenging weather conditions. Spares and tools will allow you to be more self-sufficient when it comes to mechanical issues. And gadgets may help you stay in touch, navigate more easily, or help you share your journey.</p>
<p>Gear like this gives you independence in dealing with varied situations and providing for your needs, enabling you to do more than you could by relying on outside services, yet there’s no real standard kit list. You’ll find examples at every extreme, from credit-card tourers (bicycle plus credit card) to ultra-heavyweight tourers (bicycle, four panniers, handlebar bag, trailer, guitar/surfboard strapped on top, dog, children, etc). Somewhere in the middle of the spectrum you’ll find the classic two-pannier or four-pannier setup, which is a good balance for most, which you’ll most often see on the road, and which is as close to an equipment ‘formula’ as it gets. But the bicycle is the only true common denominator, and it ultimately boils down to what gear is relevant to you. Start small. Keep it simple.</p>
<p>Equipment need not be expensive either. Splashing out on top-end stuff is fun if money is no object – why not? – but if you’re financially challenged, money doesn’t have to get in the way of your adventure. Get resourceful in other ways, both when procuring cheap or free gear and when dealing with situations on the road. Beg, borrow or steal; find free stuff on Freecycle or Gumtree; raid charity shops and car boot sales. A well-fitting bike is important, as a badly-fitting one can easily cause pain or injury, but a Tesco Value sleeping bag will keep you just as warm as a top-of-the-line The North Face one when you’re camping on the banks of the Danube in the middle of summer. Tune your gear choices to match your budget, and don’t get bogged down in online gear research. This is adventure, unpredictable things will happen, and it’s better to rely on your wit than on your kit.</p>
<p>Spending money may also be a concern in answering the ‘how’ of cycle touring. And just as when equipping yourself, the only real answer to the question of how much a bike trip costs is “as much as you want it to”. Feel free to take that literally. If you want your bike trip to cost you nothing, then go right ahead. A weekend of riding from and to your front door might be cost-free by default if you take all your food and camp wild overnight. In 2014 I cycled the length of my home country for a total cost of less than £1 to prove that in the longer-term, no-budget travel isn’t just rhetoric (not that I’m the first to do so).</p>
<p>Buy food, rather than bartering or bin-diving, and you’ll add a few pounds to your daily budget. Pay for campsites or hostels and you’ll add a bit more. Get restaurants and sightseeing into the mix and you’ll bump things up again. And on long-term trips, flights, ferries and visas might come into play. But in general you will find it’s totally possible start with the resources available to you and work from there, rather than letting the imagined cost of a bike trip stop you from doing it. If you’re planning something grander, you may well benefit from a little more cash in the bank. But the process is no more complicated. Break down the costs, set a realistic saving goal, find a way to get the money, and then go.</p>
<p>Really, though, the ‘how’ question is a red herring. Every dyed-in-the-wool cycle tourist you’ll meet will wax lyrical about how the beauty of cycle touring is in its simplicity – in the fact that all it really involves is getting on a bicycle, riding it, and responding appropriately to what rolls over the horizon.</p>
<p>Why, then, does ‘how’ to do something so simple demand such an elaborate answer?</p>
<p>It’s because, of course, the <i>real</i> concerns newcomers have are psychological. What if something goes wrong? What if I get lost? What if I run out of money? What if I can’t do it? Basically,&nbsp;<i>what if I die?</i></p>
<p>These, amongst many others, are questions that rise consciously and unconsciously. They play to our deepest fears. Left unanswered, they are capable of preventing us from following our dreams. And so they are questions we are going to spend the remainder of this guide answering.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here’s another wonderful thing about travelling by bike: you are no longer restricted to anyone else’s idea of a place worth going to. You have an enviable degree of freedom from the usual structures of tourism. And you get to decide on your own focus for travel, rather than feigning interest in what guidebooks assume everyone should be interested in.</p>
<p>Pedalling requires no refuelling facilities other than a grocery store every few days, and unlike motorists you can easily carry enough ‘fuel’ for weeks on end while you follow your nose. Carrying a tent means that, rather than worrying about finding a hotel or hostel each day, you can sleep anywhere – the further away from hotels and hostels, the better. And bus routes become things to be actively avoided, rather than impositions on where your explorations take you.</p>
<p>Sure, you’ll spend most of your time riding a road or trail of some description, because roads and trails were put there to connect people. But the range goes from smooth asphalt all the way to winding singletrack. Your options are almost limitless. Choose a good all-rounder of a bicycle and there’s almost nowhere you couldn’t go. Alternatively, choose a highly specialised touring bike – such as a luggage-equipped fatbike – and reap the rewards in that particular niche. Common touring wisdom holds that the smaller the road, the more rewarding the experience, and the further from the tourist trail, the more authentic the local welcome.</p>
<p>Amaya Williams spent years on the road before fully embracing this. “We’ve been sticking to a lot of back roads in the past couple of years and our level of satisfaction has increased immensely,” she says. “Sure, it takes longer and it’s rough going at times, but the rewards are well worth the effort.”</p>
<p>Then there’s the act of cycling itself, which encourages you to take pleasure in your surroundings. The details of the landscape and the slow evolution of nature and culture become your personal sightseeing attractions, missed by those who pass overhead at 30,000 feet or overtake you at 60mph. Whether you’re riding through the green and pleasant lands of England, the towering peaks of the Himalayas, the rainforests of South East Asia, or the deserts of Saharan Africa, bicycle travel invites you to hunt down intrigue on the roadside the world over.</p>
<p>So the question of ‘where to go’ bicycle touring is a whimsical one to which the only real answer is ‘anywhere you like’. There are very few nations on Earth in which it is impossible to travel by bicycle. Read enough blogs and trip journals and you’ll realise that cycle travellers have explored pretty much everywhere. If it’s at all possible to physically pedal a bicycle in a given place, you can probably pull off a bike trip there.</p>
<p>Visas and bureaucracy may complicate things a little bit, but this will rarely prevent you from going altogether, and there are fewer excuses than ever for not making a trip to that place you’ve always wanted to visit, or simply sticking a pin in a map. If you’re reading this, chances are you have a useful passport to travel on, and it’s worth remembering that this makes you far more mobile and unrestrained a traveller than the majority of Earth’s population, and that any additional paperwork is a relative doddle by comparison.</p>
<p>Amaya is a good example of what’s possible – with her husband Eric, she is midway through a mission to cycle <i>every country in the world</i>. At the time of writing, they’ve just passed the 100 countries mark. “Sounds daunting,” she says, “but little by little, I’m confident we’ll realise this dream.”</p>
<p>Inspiration can also be found in the story of Jumber Ledzhava, a man who, aged 52, set off to cycle every nation on Earth, <i>and</i> visit every capital city. He spent 12 years achieving this dream, mostly alone, ticking off all but five of the more than 200 countries in existence at the time and setting a new record for the world’s longest continuous bicycle journey, with over a quarter of a million kilometres of pedalling beneath his wheels.</p>
<p>What’s remarkable was that he did this as a citizen of the tiny former Soviet republic of Georgia. Without the luxury of a Western passport, he pulled off this feat by persuading diplomats the world over into granting him visas and permits through sheer determination, persistence and charisma. Something to remember, perhaps, next time we in the West are tempted to complain about having to apply in advance for a tourist visa.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ‘when’ of setting off on a bike trip is an easy one: <i>as soon as you would like</i>.</p>
<p>That might be next summer, when you’ve got the the equipment sorted, the route planned out, and the weather is optimal. It might be in a couple of years’ time, when you’ve saved a huge chunk of cash, quit your job, sold your house and are ready to begin your brand new life on the road. Or it might be tomorrow, because you’ve got a bike, you need to get away, and you can think of no genuine reason not to do so <i>right now</i>. How soon you can go on a bicycle adventure depends only on how complicated you want to make it.</p>
<p>Many assume that bike trips are restricted by season, climate and weather. But there’s almost nowhere on Earth in which it’d be impossible to do a bike trip at any time of year. Alastair Humphreys and Rob Lilwall found themselves in Siberia in midwinter, camping at temperatures down to -40ºC and passing through Yakutsk – the coldest inhabited place on Earth – on the way. (Helen Lloyd more recently repeated the feat, except in colder temperatures, on her own, and with just a bivvy bag.)</p>
<p>A few summers back I rode across the Danakil Depression in East Africa – the <i>hottest</i> inhabited place on Earth – encountering 56ºC temperatures, AK47-wielding tribal warriors, a fierce headwind, and no roads whatsoever; one of the most memorable, treasured, and brutal experiences of my life. People have ridden the Canning Stock Route across the Australian outback carrying a month’s food and several gallons of water, pinning their hopes on old colonial-era wells for survival. Others have crossed the roadless Chang Tang plateau of Tibet on bicycles, seeing no other humans for weeks, and almost dying of starvation in the process, but nevertheless making it to their destination (only to be arrested by the Chinese authorities for doing so without the proper permits).</p>
<p>It takes a certain level of experience to feel confident taking on such challenges, of course. But each and every one of those riders, at some point in their lives, was a novice too, taking their first tentative pedal strokes. The point is that you are pretty much free to ride whenever the fancy takes you, up to and beyond the edges of your comfort zone – and one day you might look back and be surprised to see how far that’s taken you.</p>
<p>Remember always that the perfect circumstances for your dream tour will never exist. “You will never simultaneously have infinite time, money, freedom and mojo,” says Alastair Humphreys. “So the best time is now.”</p>
<p>Approaching the question from a different angle, when would you actually <i>want</i> to go cycle touring?</p>
<p>Most short trips, particularly first short trips, generally seem to take place when the weather is nice. Not too hot, not too cold, not too wet or windy, and with sufficient daylight hours to get the requisite miles done before dark. On short trips there’s more emphasis on having fun during the limited time available. Riding through a fortnight of cold rain doesn’t feature on many bucket lists.</p>
<p>Most long trips, particularly first long trips, generally seem to begin in the exact same manner: leave when the weather gets nice. These days, the number of long-haul riders setting off east, across Europe and towards Asia, between May and August each year probably ranks in the thousands. For these riders, it makes sense to hit the road in time for the reliably warm European summer, where some sub-standard weather here and there doesn’t matter much in the grand scheme of things, and they’re heading for warmer climes anyway. Some set off in more challenging seasons, either because they just can’t wait to get going, or because they’ve learned the basics on previous trips and don’t mind a little extra hardship. But the general rule is that the best time to go cycling somewhere is likely to match the best time to go there on holiday.</p>
<p>And in climates where cycling in shorts and a T-shirt won’t be comfortable, your range can be greatly extended through careful choice of clothing. This is something we’ll come back to in more detail later on.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is sometimes assumed that cycle touring is the exclusive domain of the lean and lycra-clad. Since when did a ‘normal’ person get on a bike and routinely crank out between fifty and a hundred miles a day without breaking a sweat? That requires fitness, and therefore training, and therefore a passion for sport and competition, and determination and pain. Which seemingly only describes a talented and slightly masochistic elite of cyclists.</p>
<p>Except those baseline assumptions are false. Study the demographics of those actually out there wandering the world’s back roads on bicycles and you’ll find that very few are in it for the physicality or the challenge, or even for the cycling. Athleticism is a beneficial byproduct of a mode of travel that<i>creates</i> fitness as it goes. The only requirement is the ability to ride a bike without falling off – something we all learn at an early age, and for most of us our first real taste of freedom. It’s that same freedom that attracts fully-grown adults back to their bicycles when it comes to cycle touring.</p>
<p>Sure, if you’ve spent the last few years indulging a little too heavily in sofa- or office-based activities, you’re not going to hit the ground running, so to speak. But you don’t need to. Nobody’s waiting for you at the finish line with a stopwatch. You can take all the time you need to get where you’re going. Who’s going to know how long it took (except you) and does it matter if it takes a little longer? You’ll only see more of the world as you go.</p>
<p>You see, it won’t be long before you shift your attention away from your lacklustre mileage and towards the ever-changing landscape, the opportunities to explore, and the people and oddities you’ll stumble upon. You’ll find that slowness actually <i>amplifies</i> the intrigue of exploring new roads. Pedalling along, beholden to no-one and nothing, you’ll start to wonder: why would anyone take the freedom afforded by the humble bicycle and squander it on a mad dash to the finish line?</p>
<p>Allow days and weeks to pass by and you’ll find that something even stranger happens. The aches and pains subside. The saddle actually starts to feel rather comfortable, as though you’re ‘becoming one with the bike’. You’re no longer thinking about the cycling itself or how hard or strange it is, because it’s getting easier and more natural by the day as your experience grows, and you’ve got more interesting things to think about anyway. And the moment will come when you realise you’ve got on a bike that morning and cranked out a hundred leisurely miles without even noticing.</p>
<p>Because you, as a human, by applying yourself to something new, have done what millions of years of evolution have optimised you for. You have <i>adapted</i>.</p>
<p>And so cycle touring – far from demanding a level of skill and strength available only to the chosen few – is in fact one of the most egalitarian types of adventure there is. Try it. Take this simple man-powered machine, combine with your naturally curious spirit, and see where you end up.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Climbing aboard a bicycle is perhaps the most accessible way to have an adventure.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have to involve quitting your job, spending years planning, or embarking upon a long-winded odyssey of self discovery. It doesn’t have to be heroic. It need not involve ‘epic’ days in the saddle, or energy gels, or lycra. Nor does such a journey necessitate physical hardship, heavy traffic, mountain ranges and continental crossings on £5 a day and with nothing but pasta and stock-cubes for sustenance.</p>
<p>It can involve all of these things, of course. But sometimes it can simply mean going somewhere new, nosing around for long enough to unwind from daily life, and coming home refreshed. That could describe a weekend as well as a year on the road.</p>
<p>Cycle touring is whatever you want it to be. And you can call it whatever you like – cycle touring, adventure cycling, bikepacking, even simply travelling by bicycle; these are all nuanced terms for the act of getting on a bike and going on a journey with it.</p>
<p>While a short trip is enough for many, some choose to take things further. The number of people who have cycled round the world could be easily estimated to be in the thousands. Still more have made unique adaptations to the basic formula. Joff Summerfield has so far made three attempts to encircle the planet on a penny farthing. Tom Kevill-Davies based a transcontinental trip entirely on sampling and recording local recipes. Emily Chappell got her adventuring rocks off by cycling across Alaska in the depths of winter on a ‘fatbike’.</p>
<p>Even these are conservative examples. Delve deeper into the stories out there and you’ll find dudes building custom surfboard carriers for their tourers and riding sandy coastlines in search of the perfect break. You’ll find people taking ultralight bikepacking rigs and charting the unmapped dirt trails of South America, riding tall bikes the length of Africa, and forming bands and roaming Europe on busking bike trips. You’ll find families cycling across continents with children of all ages, homeschooling in their tents by night and taking them on the best field trips imaginable by day.</p>
<p>You’ll find people recreating traditional rite-of-passage journeys in full costume, people earning a living on the road by selling hand-made jewellery on exotic beaches, people riding from farm to farm as they work their way around the world. You’ll find cyclist photographers who spend months exploring on the proceeds of roadside postcard sales. You’ll hear of people dishing out bicycle-powered smoothies, not for money but just because they could. You’ll find people who travel money-free and barter, dumpster-dive and volunteer their way across countries and continents. Whatever kind of eccentricity you might imagine, be sure that someone is out there doing it on a bicycle.</p>
<p>Yes, you’re allowed to have fun with cycle touring. Not the type of fun you later convince yourself you had. Actual, real fun. Sit by the riverside and read your favourite book. Wallow in a state of post-lunch, post-beer tranquility for hours every afternoon. Cook elaborate meals. Eat ice cream. Brew coffee. Occasionally, do some cycling.</p>
<p>Sleep in wonderful, wild places that only you will ever know. Sleep in terrible, ill-advised places where no-one would dream of looking. Meet new people every day. Ride across deserts in a state of utter solitude. Ignore everything except what’s happening right here, right now. Daydream until you can’t remember where you are.</p>
<p>Leave your phone and laptop at home. I dare you. I double-dare you. Throw out your calendar. Spontaneously change your plans, your flights, your future. Cycle touring can feel like the closest thing to freedom you’ll ever experience. Embrace it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today is a big day for me: it’s the official launch day of my fourth book!</p>
<p><i>The TomsBikeTrip.com Guide To Adventure Cycle Touring</i> is a&nbsp;condensed, refined, 80,000-word version of all the advice I’ve ever given to newcomers on how to get started in the world of bicycle travel. The international Kindle edition is on sale at the entry level price of £4.99, and it’s <a href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/cycle-touring-ebook/">available now</a>&nbsp;(with the lovely cover photo above courtesy of <a href="http://www.swedentoafrica.com/" target="_blank">Carl-David Granbäck</a>).</p>
<p>To celebrate the launch, this week I’m going to be running a series of extracts from the book’s introduction. They constitute my personal answers to the big questions about cycle touring. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">What</span> is it exactly? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who</span> can do it? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Where</span> can it take you? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When’s</span> the best time to go? And <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how</span> does it actually work?</p>
<p>But today I want to pose the biggest question of all:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why</span> would anyone travel by bicycle?</strong></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>When you get into a car, onto a train or plane or bus – even when you leave the house on foot – you do so almost always with the intention of going somewhere. You have a destination in mind, and your mode of transport is simply how you get there.</p>
<p>When you pack a suitcase, buy a ticket, plan an itinerary or open a guidebook, you are participating in a kind of travel that casts experiences as discrete and consumable, and places as destinations to go to and return from. Time spent in motion is something to be endured, and preferably minimised.</p>
<p>Yet in order to see the point of travelling by bicycle – and thus to understand “why” one might travel by bicycle – you must abandon this contemporary understanding of travel.</p>
<p>I’ve tried to explain this in so many ways. I’ll say that when I left England and cycled to Istanbul, I was… no! Too late. <em>He cycled from England to Istanbul! That’s a really long way to ride a bicycle. I could never do that.</em></p>
<p>Yes, I cycled to Istanbul. But what really happened was this:</p>
<p>I woke up every morning in my tent or on someone’s floor.</p>
<p>I had my breakfast.</p>
<p>I began riding, often in the general direction of Turkey (i.e. south-east).</p>
<p>One day, many months later, I arrived in Istanbul.</p>
<p>In the same way, I cycled to Yerevan, to Cairo, to Djibouti and Muscat and Tehran and Ulan Bator and Tromsø and Vancouver and San Francisco and Ahvaz and Bandar Abbas.</p>
<p>Why did I bother spending all this time just to get where I was going?</p>
<p><strong>Because people travel by bicycle for everything other than arriving at the destination.</strong></p>
<p>The point, always, is being <em>here</em>, not getting somewhere else.</p>
<p>The act of arrival anywhere is little more than the pressing of a ‘pause’ button on a scrolling, living tapestry; a fly-on-the-wall reality documentary with no beginning and no end and no meaning other than what you choose to ascribe to it; one that unfolds as you pedal, right there before your eyes and ears and nose and mouth, beneath your feet and at your fingertips, every waking second.</p>
<p>Bicycle travel is a call-to-arms to engage with life – and to learn to accept and tolerate it all; for how is one anonymous and transient figure on a pushbike supposed to wreak her particular brand of change upon the strangers she meets with any kind of objectivity or understanding? Better just to watch.</p>
<p>The road is a cruel teacher, hurling bad decisions back in your face without mercy. But it is also one that rewards those who exercise patience and trust and openness with fuel for the soul of the kind that’s fast becoming one of the world’s most scarce natural resources: that of real, meaningful, spontaneous contact at an intensely human level.</p>
<p>You will be changed by the experience of open-ended, freeform bicycle travel, because if you choose to participate in it, you must be seeking a change. You cannot be content in order to want to do this. You’re feeling a faraway call.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>It may not be obvious why the bicycle, specifically, is so enormously well-suited to delivering this all-encompassing experience of travel, as compared to, say, travelling on foot, or by motorbike.</p>
<p>The reasons are pretty simple.</p>
<p>There’s the inertia delivered by the machine itself – the fact that you release the brakes and stop pedalling and yet you continue to roll forward – that sets in motion that scrolling tapestry of life. The is what makes the bicycle beautiful and timeless. Our legs will never evolve to deliver this.</p>
<p>Then there is the exquisite participatory nature of the experience. There is a direct correlation between effort and reward. You get out precisely what you put in. Each gruelling climb delivers a matching descent that you may spend at your leisure, whether you’re the type to blow it all in one go for a quick shot of adrenaline, or canter relaxedly down, savouring each tree and flower and blade of grass and friendly wave. In the same way, a long day’s pedalling will be rewarded by sleep of a depth to rival the dead. No motorised form of transport can deliver this.</p>
<p>Then there is the immediacy of your engagements with those you meet on the roadside. Your strongest memories will be of time spent with friendly strangers who became friends in a the space of a smile and a handshake. You will feel guilty that you ever viewed people through other eyes.</p>
<p>But of all the reasons “why” one should travel by bicycle, perhaps the most important for me is the stripping-back of life to its absolute essentials – mentally, physically and spiritually. Because to my mind, the greatest freedom one can have is to be self-directed, able-bodied, responsible, and fully aware of what matters most in life for each and every waking second.</p>
<p>Travelling by bicycle offers a rare and precious opportunity to be all of those things.</p>
<p>So, at the end of all of this, my question to you is:</p>
<p><strong>Why on Earth would anyone&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>not</em></span> travel by bicycle?</strong></p>
<p># # #</p>
<p>If you’re a newcomer to all this, you’re convinced by my flowery rhetoric, and you’d like to give cycle touring a go, I really hope you’ll <a href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/cycle-touring-ebook/">check out the new book</a>. I really think it’s going to come in useful.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is it. The final push to Bandar Abbas. My train leaves tomorrow at noon.</p>
<p>In the predawn cool I hit the road east, setting a fast pace for what will be the longest day of this ride. But before long&nbsp;I spot a bakery churning out fresh sheets of lavash onto a cooling rack on the roadside. I stop and buy a loaf for breakfast, and the interruption makes space for me to remind myself that speed is not the essence today. Miles go by when time in the saddle is maximised, and often that means dropping the pace to sustain it. Besides that, I must remember that I’m still allowed to enjoy my final day, rather than end my ride on a miserable dash to the finish line.</p>
<p>There is little noteworthy about the road, its purpose&nbsp;to channel traffic from all over south-west Iran into Bandar Abbas. The asphalt widens to two lanes, sometimes with a generous hard shoulder, sometimes with none. I concentrate on keeping myself safe, not noticing the landscape, suddenly disoriented as I realise the sea has disappeared from view, or that I’m riding across an Africa-like savannah roamed by dromedaries.</p>
<p>In between traffic-dodging and wondering why every other Iranian truck has the logo of Mammut (a Swiss outdoor gear company) painted all over it, I reflect on the lessons learned from this, my sixth journey in the Islamic Republic of Iran, and the third by bicycle. As usual, what floats to the surface is a mixture of tempting generalisations about a nation and ponderings on my subjective experience here.</p>
<p>This trip has left an interesting impression of Iran. The country’s unabated progress into modernity is impressive – even heroic – given the circumstances, but things suffer, it seems, from what is perhaps an overemphasis on discipline and control in order to keep things working properly; one of the&nbsp;less obvious results of decades of international sanctions.</p>
<p>To me, surface-skimming traveller that I am, this has been most noticeable in the repurposing of traditional ways of life to serve centrally-owned state mechanisms – individual self-reliance giving way to national survival.</p>
<p>Thus are&nbsp;age-old cultural mores&nbsp;bedecked with the raiments of&nbsp;industrialism. Even if the mountain-dwelling shepherd remains, he’ll likely be heading home on a Honda CG125 to eat traditional bread baked on a mechanised conveyor belt, sitting on the floor in front of a&nbsp;Western-style sofa watching a period soap-opera set in the imperial courts of the Persian empire on a Samsung flatscreen telly.&nbsp;The Shah’s rapid Westernisation of Iran largely fuelled the revolutionary backlash of ’79, but the mullahs who replaced him have only continued on this particular trajectory.</p>
<p>There’s nothing particularly unusual about these materialist features of modern life. What’s distinctive is how homogenous –&nbsp;even bland – this aspect of Iran&nbsp;looks as a result. My perspective is&nbsp;perhaps accentuated by two things. The first is the inevitable comparison&nbsp;with Armenia, a country among whose charms I count the wonderfully traditional&nbsp;approach to food and produce, where the windows of opportunity to enjoy the cascading banquets of seasonal fruits and vegetables are measured in mere days – days often characterised by furious bouts of pickling and preserving. It’s a place where organic, home-made cheese and yoghurt and honey is not just plentiful and cheap but almost ubiquitous, as likely to be brought over by a friend or relative as bought from a shop. It’s where big business, for all its attempts, seems unable to get its teeth into the feeding of the country.</p>
<p>All of this I love and value so highly that coming to Iran – a mass-produced, shrink-wrapped conveyor belt of monotony for breakfast, lunch and tea – is a shock. Sure, there are a few places you can find fantastic, memorable meals. Stay in a few villages and you <em>might</em> get a taste of a homemade or homegrown something-or-other. But they’re the exception that proves the rule.</p>
<p>The second is that before I drifted nomadically to Armenia, my frame of reference was England, a place where the soulless industrialisation of the food supply was long ago&nbsp;obscured beneath a&nbsp;camouflage of marketing, nowadays reaching ever more absurd levels of disconnection from the actual thing being put in one’s mouth, all fuelled by an institutionalised prerogative to ‘remain competitive’ in a&nbsp;free-market economy that has conquered life entirely. In England, food wasn’t just food any more, as made explicit by one Marks &amp; Spencers campaign. Even the reactionary movements – slow food, farmers markets etc – have to be sold in the same language to get&nbsp;cash-rich, time-poor dilettante foodies buying into&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>It makes me think: at least Iran’s new-found obsession with mass production and consumption is honest. Nothing’s trying to be anything it isn’t. Just check out the names of the firms that make this stuff: ‘Kalleh Dairy Company’, ‘Behrouz Nik Food Industries’, ‘Bijan Food Products’, ‘Khoshkpak Dried Food Company’. Function over form. Pure utilitarianism. Nobody’s trying to spin it: everything is out in plain view.&nbsp;There is none of the West’s&nbsp;fabricated diversification.&nbsp;Everywhere in Iran, everything is the same. The same three or four makes of car, the same single model of motorbike, every loaf of bread a tasteless carbon copy of the one before it. This is a zero-choice economy; you know exactly what you’re going to get, right down to the price. If you want something different, something <em>better</em>; if you aren’t content with a system that serves all your basic needs but doesn’t try to convince you it’ll make you happy too – well, you can either go where the tourists and rich kids spend their money, or you can leave Iran. (And many do.)</p>
<p>I see a restaurant on the roadside. I know it’s a restaurant because the sign outside reads ‘Restaurant’. Fifty miles pedalled before lunch, the ten-kilometre countdown signs to Bandar Abbas down into double digits, I decide to treat myself to a hot meal. I scan the menu which contains the same dozen or so&nbsp;dishes served in every roadside restaurant in Iran: four varieties of kebab, three stews, and a couple of&nbsp;soups. The prices are exactly the same as they are everywhere else.</p>
<p>I order. The meal is precisely&nbsp;as expected: a huge pile of steaming rice, a bowl of stew, and some perfect geometric squares of bread in a plastic basket. Zero-choice economy? Sure as hell works for me.</p>
<p>At a police roadblock I skip the queue, weaving among idling pickups and cars full of holidaymakers and petrol tankers covered in Mammut logos. A policeman waves me over. The first thing he wants to know is where I’m from.</p>
<p>“Armenia,” I tell him. I find myself wondering if my shorts will prove an issue. While men aren’t generally supposed to wear shorts in Iran, a ‘sportsperson’ can usually get away with it in practice.</p>
<p>“Armenia!” he repeats, enthusiastically, if a little absent-mindedly. “And how is Iran?”</p>
<p>“Iran is great!” I reply. Standard response.</p>
<p>“Yes, Iran is great! See what a safe and stable place this is! Have you had any problems on the road? Has anyone done anything to disturb you here? No! Everything is provided, travelling is safe, there’s no war, by the grace of God…”</p>
<p>I nod profusely. He’s proud of his country. And why not? People only complain about a lack of freedom when they take stability for granted. Then, with a flippant wave, his attention is on the next driver, and I am forgotten, along with my shorts.</p>
<p>It is the innocuous question – “where are you from?” – that prompts the next thought spiral. Really, I am from England, not Armenia, as that’s where I was born. But what is England but a subdivision of the island of Great Britain based on some ancient tribal war? What does that have to do with me? Really, I am from Middleton, a small village in the East Midlands full of middle-class white people. That’s the place that served as the womb of my childhood worldview, not some abstract thing called ‘England’.</p>
<p>But until the age of five I’d lived in the schoolhouse of a Surrey village school of which my dad was the headmaster. My memories of the place are few and fleeting, but they are nonetheless my earliest memories. So was I from Middleton, or Ockley?</p>
<p>And from age 11 I was shipped off daily to a secondary school in a nearby town which, at the time, seemed far more exotic and dangerous and confusing than anywhere I’ve travelled as an adult. Middleton was just where I slept. My village friends went elsewhere. Later,&nbsp;going to university at the far end of Britain&nbsp;– which might as well have been another actual universe – eroded further&nbsp;that sense of rootedness that society tells me I should have, the one that eventually brings so many travellers&nbsp;– no matter how prolonged and far-ranging and mind-expanding their adventures – back ‘home’.</p>
<p>Finally, hitting&nbsp;the road a decade ago didn’t just destroy any lingering remnants of a settled life, it affirmed and made real my identity as a wanderer – which didn’t mean I would never have a ‘home’, just that I would begin to conceive of it in an entirely different way. I would take my home with me, and set it up where I felt like. It’s taken a few years to fully embrace this, but now I can truly say that my home is nowhere and everywhere. Of course visiting the place I grew up brings feelings of nostalgia, but nothing more. I spend my time&nbsp;where I come across cosmopolitan pockets of like-minded humans, not&nbsp;to where any geographical yearning drags me back.</p>
<p>Thus, while I have a practical standard-issue answer for the policeman on Highway 96 towards Bandar Abbas, the exchange smooths over a complex question, one I’ve always felt society wants me to have a simple answer for, but which in all honesty I do not. I’m not sure I&nbsp;even have the language to discuss this all properly. It seems to me that we live in an age characterised by humans pushing up against the limits of their ability to get their heads round&nbsp;the complexities of the world. Perhaps this has somehow always been the case. Thanks to the internet and smartphones, a fantastic increase in the availability of information has made it&nbsp;easier than ever to hold forth intellectually&nbsp;on matters of which we are actually ignorant, to let fragments of information bribe us into believing we understand universal wholes, to reduce matters of dazzling intricacy and depth to ever-more meaningless caricatures. All this is fuelled by&nbsp;a fundamental need to feel that we understand life, because without certainty, without <em>belief</em>, we feel insecure, and, ultimately, afraid. What is unknown terrifies us: knowledge makes us&nbsp;comfortable, even if that knowledge is flawed. I think the difference today is that – on a global scale – it’s really starting to matter.</p>
<p>Another thing I suspect is that the pursuit of learning and understanding as the way to solve the mysteries of the world&nbsp;is misguided. All we can be reasonably sure of, ever, is that the cumulative effect of our experiences have shaped our self-image and how we respond to the events of life. But that’s going to pan out differently for the other 7.5 billion of us. ‘Knowledge’ is nothing more than what we can each deduce from experience, or adopt from the deductions of others. And&nbsp;relying too heavily on this is intrinsically dangerous: we are susceptible to all sorts of irrationalities, flawed logic, misperception and misinterpretation – the most insidious outcome being the ‘generalisation’, such as those I’m guilty of earlier in this post. Not to mention our squishy, simplistic memories that recall things that never happened and twist things that did. Healthier, I reckon, to accept – to <em>really accept</em> – the enormity of what we do not and cannot ever know or understand – that every belief we hold could, given sufficient time or change of perspective, be opposed; that each new thing learned is a hint to the vastness of things we will never have the opportunity&nbsp;to learn – and proceed through life on that basis: more tolerant, less judgemental, aware of the enormity of what we do not and cannot know, and resultantly&nbsp;in a greater state of peace.</p>
<p>But man, it’s <em>hard</em>.</p>
<p>From this perspective,&nbsp;many immutable truths seem to rest on shaky foundations. It’s the place all the subtexts of&nbsp;the question “where are you from?” come from. Literally what the hell does that even mean? The word ‘country’ is notoriously hard to define, linguistically speaking. The idea of nationhood is even more slippery. What on earth does it mean to say that I am ‘Armenian’? My second passport makes this a legal truth. But when I was born, the country didn’t even exist! More to the point, most Armenians define themselves along ethnic lines: ‘Armenian-ness’ is purely about blood and nothing to do with where one was born, in contrast to ‘Britishness’ in which outsiders have traditionally been invited to integrate. By that definition, there are far more Armenians outside Armenia&nbsp;than in it, far more Armenians holding the passports of <em>other</em> countries than that of their supposed homeland. And let’s not even get into questions of territorial heritage: today’s Republic of Armenia is but a dismal representation of lands once inhabited&nbsp;by the ancestors of a now globally-scattered people. All <em>I</em> did was get married there. And in a couple of years, I’ll be eligible to run for presidency!</p>
<p>Depending on how you define ‘English’, ‘Armenian’, and the concept of nationality, I am either one, both, or neither. Which calls into question the value of any such label, and makes me wonder why society remains obsessed by them.</p>
<p>But I suspect it’s rather simple. The vast majority of people have a strong and singular sense of home. This usually corresponds with the place where and the people among whom they grew up. And that social-geographical sense of home is a fundamental part of most people’s identity. Our current system of nation-labels helps people figure out who they think I am in this sense – what tribe I belong to; what that tribe’s relationship is with theirs; therefore how they should relate to me. That’s what most people are&nbsp;asking when they’re asking where I’m from. And I’ve been asked where I’m from probably tens of thousands of times.</p>
<p>I, however, am one of a significant&nbsp;minority who’ve found themselves instead drawn to the nomadic life – the frowned-upon alternative to settling which has always existed in one form or another, marginalised by mainstream society, but ultimately resulting in humans exploring and populating every inch of habitable space on Earth. At a fundamental level, our sense of <em>home</em> and what it means is just different – and therefore our sense of identity and what <em>that</em> means is different too.</p>
<p>Now, in the 21st century, the life of the nomad bears little resemblance to the romantic notion of the word. But the same is true for the settler. What both groups share today is the ability to participate in an economy no longer constrained by physical geography – even if many can’t see or understand this, and even if many nomadic souls haven’t found their way out of settledom yet.</p>
<p>And perhaps that’s why the question “where are you from?” heralds the premature death of meaningful interaction. Because before the conversation has even begun, we are already speaking different languages about the nature of self and identity; the age-old divide of the nomad versus the settler. And&nbsp;that is the fate of the solo bicycle traveller. Interactions, however heartfelt, are fleeting. Alone on the road, the deepest conversations are inevitably the ones you have with yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This nomad still has fifty miles to pedal before dark, and the sun is already sinking towards the western horizon. I take a detour across the desert on a crumbling old road, cutting off a big inland loop made by the highway. A few optimistic motorists have decided to try it too, but such is the dereliction of this abandoned strip of asphalt that I easily overtake the drivers as they negotiate car-sized potholes and corrugated trails of compacted gravel in cars entirely unsuited to the task. It’s a fun hour of riding, but the trucking route reappears all too quickly, and the combination of dusk, busy highway, and approaching industrial sprawl promises a predictably unappetising arrival in Bandar Abbas.</p>
<p>And it is even more hostile than I imagined. As if spawned by an unseen force, the trucks begin to multiply. Darkness grows, my rear light feebly poking at the mounting onslaught of roaring lorries, and at the same time the hard shoulder begins to accumulate all the pulverised crumbs of tarmac and road filth and desert dust thrown off by these monsters as they plough towards the port. Soon the detritus is so thick that it’s like trying to ride through loose gravel, my tyres skidding and churning in the darkness. But it’s either that or share a lane with a thousand tonnes of hurtling steel.</p>
<p>Deafening blast after deafening blast. Pathetic head-torch. Adrenaline-fuelled dashes for solid ground as I gain a hundred yards at a time in rare breaks between cavalcades. It’s actually like being at war. All thoughts of my destination have evaporated. This is about survival. And though I hesitate to admit it as I know my mum will be reading this, I’m having the most perverse kind of fun! Because though it’s objectively horrific, I’ve been here so many times before. I know I can deal with this. Such violence inspires heroic efforts, and this is all about riding that wave through; about sticking a big fat <em>fuck you</em> to the world that has created such diabolisms and doing what needs to be done, preferably with a smile on your face, pushing on until the end of eternity comes.</p>
<p>It is late at night when the first ‘hotel’ signboard heaves into view. It’s a little way out of town, but I couldn’t care less. I march in brandishing a 50 Toman note and ask, politely, if they’ll give me a room for all the cash I have left. Not only do they give me a room but they send up dinner too.</p>
<p>I collapse into bed. I have ridden 130 miles. I have made it to Bandar Abbas. And I have survived.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I let myself out and am down at the beach before dawn. The town’s name, Bandar-e Aftab, translates to ‘Sun Port’. It’s obvious why: this little south-facing stretch of coastline is bathed in its rays from sunrise to sunset. Being a mediterranean sea, isolated from the Indian Ocean by the Straits of Hormoz and just fifty metres deep on average, the Persian Gulf hosts one of the calmest coastlines I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p>A hundred yards away, some&nbsp;fishermen are dragging a boat across the sand towards the water, but aside from that, all is still and silent. I experience the kind of sunrise that travel photographers fly halfway round the world to capture.</p>
<p>And then, once more, I ride. The world stirs into motion even as its inhabitants sleep. The air is cool and delicious. Riding remains effortless. All is harmony.</p>
<p>Ancient-looking domes litter the sand flats&nbsp;between the seashore and&nbsp;the rocky rise of the coastal mountains. I stop and approach one. The conical dome, about the height of a single storey building, has four equally-spaced entrances, each framed by a rectangle of stone. I step through one of them, recoiling as&nbsp;the floor falls away: I am poised on the edge of a deep well. Twenty feet below me I see the reflection of my own silhouette in the water. The cistern must be have once been a source of drinking water in a land dominated by salt and sand – and indeed, a bucket attached to a frayed rope is leaning up against the opposite doorway. Continuing to ride, I see dozens more domes, so numerous they could almost be dwellings.</p>
<p>Approaching Bandar-e Charak, the road widens, and suddenly the remote coastal trail is transformed in a multi-lane highway. No doubt built to fulfil some national standard, it seems to have been plonked arbitrarily in the remote coastal desert to herald the final half-mile before the edge of the town.</p>
<p>There’s something different about Charak. I follow the promenade along the beach, empty as usual; past the boatyard. I stop to take a photo or two with my phone. I cross the road to fill up my bottles from a roadside water cooler. Nobody pays me the slightest attention. Nobody even looks at me.</p>
<p>A couple of hundred yards away&nbsp;is the reason. Bandar-e Charak is one of two ports plied by passenger ferries to the nearby island of Kish (pronounced like ‘quiche’). Though I’ve never visited, I’ve been hearing of Kish for years: it’s one of those ‘must-visit’ places Iranians like to mention in conversations about travelling in the country, like Esfahan and Shiraz. In truth, it’s more of a domestic destination, for Kish’s fame comes from its transformation from desert island to luxury holiday resort, complete with 5-star hotels, Western-style shopping malls, duty-free luxury imports from the Emirates, and a particularly liberal attitude to beach life. A novelty destination for Iranians with money to spend, and an utterly run-of-the-mill (perhaps even horrifying) prospect for a&nbsp;Western traveller in search of the romantic and exotic of the Orient.</p>
<p>I wheel up&nbsp;by the port gates just as ferry is unloading its payload of Persian holidaymakers. The road is soon swarming with legions of the moneyed classes, glamorous-looking women hurriedly readjusting from days of relative abandon to the mainland’s concern with dress code and propriety, husbands and fathers engaged in the serious concern of locating a parked car or negotiating with a taxi driver. It’s milling with suitcases and shouting matches and the paraphernalia of a million prodigious Persian picnics. One man appears to be shoving a full-size oven into the back of a car. Another is strapping clear plastic cases full of gaudily patterned, carefully-folded blankets to a roof rack. Drivers tout ever-falling fares to Bandar Abbas, from where many of these holidaymakers will take the same train to Tehran that I’ll be taking a couple of days from now. It’s a scene of the daily chaos that characterises a place whose sole raison d’etre is as a conduit for money-wielding outsiders, the locals’ jobs being to extract their cash in brief flurries of activity like this.</p>
<p>I leave just as abruptly as I’d arrived.</p>
<p>On my way out of town, a cavalcade of taxi drivers and truck drivers advise me to avoid the coastal road at all costs. “It’s shit,” they tell me. “Take the highway inland. Faster and easier, and not much longer. It goes all the way to Bandar Abbas.”</p>
<p>I take the coastal road. It’s shit. It’s a hundred times more preferable than sharing the highway with the cavalcade of taxi drivers and truck drivers who’ll never understand why I’d choose a shit road over a highway.</p>
<p>The disintegrating asphalt collapses into dirt and sand, ploughing south through the desert. Dromedaries roam the plains, mooching among distant cisterns. I rattle along the washboard track, spotting a pair of motorbikes coming towards me. As they draw closer, I realise they’re not motorbikes. They’re cyclists!</p>
<p>“Salaam!” I hail. “Chetorid?-khoobid?-salaamati-ghorbanet-kheyli-mamnoon!”</p>
<p>By the time&nbsp;this classic exchange of introductory etiquette is complete, I know for sure&nbsp;they’re Iranian. The couple straddle heavily-loaded hybrid bikes with flat handlebars and front suspension, panniers and bar bags, and the biggest tent I’ve ever seen strapped to the guy’s rear rack. It looks like an ex-issue military tent. But if that’s all you can get, so be it. With my ultralight rig, I’m already in awe of their determination to drag this mass of equipment through the desert. Good for them!</p>
<p>“You’re the last person we expected to meet on this road!”, the man exclaims.</p>
<p>“So are you!” I reply with a grin.</p>
<p>“But why are you here, instead of on the main road with the cars and trucks?”</p>
<p>“Because of the cars and trucks!”</p>
<p>He smiles in appreciation of the discovery that I, a foreigner, am just as comfortable off the beaten track in Iran as he is in his native country, and that ultimately we’ve both chosen this road for the same reason: it’s a blank spot on the map and our curiosity has drawn us here. He speaks English (badly) and I speak Farsi (badly), whereas his wife speaks only Farsi. Somehow we each end up using each others’ language (badly) to conduct the conversation, and somehow it works.</p>
<p>The couple, from Tehran, have had a similar idea to me: escape the winter by heading to the south of the country and exploring its coastline and islands. They’ve already visited Hormoz and Qeshm via the passenger ferries from Bandar Abbas and are now on their way to Charak to catch the boat to Kish. Apparently, he tells me, there’s car ferry from Bandar-e Pol to Qeshm island, crossing the narrowest point between the two coastlines several times a day.</p>
<p>“If they think you’re Iranian,” he says, “they won’t charge you, so say as little as possible and just ride straight onto the boat!”</p>
<p>I thank him for his suggestion, though I won’t have time to go to Qeshm on this trip. I wish I did – the newly designated UNESCO Geopark that occupies the western half of the island is apparently home to some of the most unique landscapes on Earth.</p>
<p>It’s nice to meet them. We wish each other well and ride off in opposite directions, our spirits a little higher. For one thing, it lays to rest a myth I’d seen being propagated on the internet; the crass generalisation that “cycling in Iran is illegal for women”. Ever hungry for stories to fuel anti-Iranian sentiment, the Western media had, earlier in the year, picked up on a comment from a prominent cleric about whether female cyclists risked contravening sharia law as practiced in Iran. The story was spun by tabloid headline writers – among the lowest scum on Earth, in my opinion – simply as “women banned from cycling in Iran”.</p>
<p>There was no appreciation of the fact that the comment was specifically about the interplay between Iran’s dress code regulations&nbsp;and cycling, not about the act of riding a bike. Nor did any of the reporters seem to understand that such questions&nbsp;flex in interpretation depending on the nuances of each individual case. So no, it wouldn’t be OK for a woman in skin-tight lycra to ride tucked through downtown Tehran. But yes, it would be perfectly OK for a modestly-dressed bicycle traveller to explore the countryside – or to commute to work, or to use the cycle lanes and bike hire facilities in any number of Iranian cities. I am not, of course, defending the theocrats here, just pointing out that – as with so many tiresome headlines about Iran – the reality is far more subtle&nbsp;than you’d be led to think.</p>
<p>The same nuances were also missed by an irate pro-cyclist who’d been to the Iranian Embassy in London to apply for a visa to cycle across Iran and been refused on the grounds that such a thing was&nbsp;not allowed. She’d reacted to my Tweet that I’d be cycling in Iran by telling me that I was lucky; that what I was doing was a “male-only privilege”. I sympathised with her anger, however forthright, but all that had really happened was that she’d made the mistake of mentioning cycling in the first place. Cycle travellers to Iran have long been advised to avoid doing so when applying for visas, regardless of gender. Had she applied as a regular visitor, I suspect she’d have got the visa and encountered no problems whatsoever – like all the other female cycle travellers who pass through Iran, and like the Iranian cyclist I’d just met. I’d done my best to appease her indignance and said I hoped she’d get a chance to ride in Iran in the future, because (in case you haven’t noticed) I’d made it my mission to proselytise the discovery of this nation to travellers in any way I could.</p>
<p>My little scenic detour is sadly short-lived. Soon I’m back at a junction with the main road to Bandar-e Lengeh. Petrol tankers and container lorries fly past at speed in anticipation of the industrialised towns and ports that surround the south coast hub of Bandar Abbas. So far I’ve avoided piling into the fray, but it seems that time is through.</p>
<p>Many newcomers to global cycling adventures imagine all sorts of silly things to be the main dangers to personal safety – banditry, kidnapping, terrorism, starvation, ad infinitum. As any experienced bicycle traveller will know, however, by far the biggest threat is road traffic. When a rare story does sadly surface about the death of a cycle tourist, it is inevitably the result of a collision with a vehicle – itself an inevitability of having to share all sorts of entirely inappropriate roads with every other kind of road user.</p>
<p>I know this only too well. The closest I have ever come to dying on a bike trip was on <a href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/video-letter-from-lapland/">an ice road in Swedish Lapland</a>. It was the dead of night, about -30ºC at the time, but freezing to death was the least of my concerns. Far more worrying was the truckers’ habit of&nbsp;blasting through the icy wilderness leaving no space between their enormous vehicles and the vertical walls of snow that lined the roadsides. The sides of these single-lane trenches were often taller than I was. And that was OK when the roads were straight enough for drivers to see my bright red rear blinker in the distance. But on one long right-hand bend – neither tight enough to necessitate slowing down, nor broad enough for me to be visible until the last second – I was unfortunate enough to hear the roar of a truck approaching, the full-beam headlights reflecting awfully off the snowdrifts on the opposite side of the road. With no change in the engine’s tone or timbre, I knew the trucker had no idea I was there. I pulled to a halt, rammed the right end of my handlebar into the wall of snow to make myself as narrow as possible, and braced myself, as the glare of the headlights and the scream of the engine engulfed me…</p>
<p>The truck missed me by inches. If I hadn’t stopped; if I had wobbled just slightly to the left – perhaps, even, if I hadn’t dug my handlebar into the snow at the last second… well, I suspect I would not be writing this right now.</p>
<p>The driver probably wouldn’t even have known he’d hit me.</p>
<p>You develop certain habits as a travelling cyclist; survival strategies that initially rub against such Western notions as having the same right to use the road as anyone else, that drivers should behave responsibility towards more vulnerable road users, and other such forward-thinking&nbsp;concepts. Trust me – when your life depends on a few hundred other drivers a day not running you over, and when most of the world’s drivers treat traffic rules and road markings as an exotic and meaningless novelty, you quickly realise you’d be better off establishing your own habits of self-preservation, because you can’t very well argue about safe overtaking distances or waiting until the lane is clear when you’ve been mashed into the tarmac.</p>
<p>Iran offers a slight deviation from the norm in that it is overrun with motorbikes, which occupy about the same amount of space on the road as bicycles and are usually moving slower than other traffic. Drivers are used to them, and this usually plays in the cyclist’s favour. Even so, there are still scenarios when a motorbike rider knows it’s time to dive off the road and onto the verge. One of those scenarios is when you’re on a fast, single-lane thoroughfare, just wide enough for two trucks to pass each other at full speed in opposite directions, with no hard shoulder. So whenever I see vehicles approaching from ahead on the other side of the road, my first instinct is to look <em>behind</em> to see if they’re likely to intersect with someone overtaking me from behind. If they are, and if both vehicles are big ones, then I get the hell off the road immediately. On this road, with the asphalt giving way to a slope of rubble down to the desert floor, the result is that I spend quite a lot of time skidding around in the dust.</p>
<p>Other habitual reactions become noticeable – like my tendency to ride a little further away from the verge than I really need to, most of the way towards the centre of the lane. As long as there’s no traffic approaching from up ahead, this tends to mean that overtaking drivers from behind give me a wide berth, but also – more importantly – that I have space to swerve a couple of feet closer to the road’s edge, just a split-second before they pass, so even the drivers who wouldn’t give me an inch of space find themselves passing at a comfortable margin.</p>
<p>Together with others techniques, like wearing brightly-coloured clothing, these survival strategies have kept me safe through the years. But the road I’m on is still up there with the most dismal I’ve encountered. Given the approaching city, I can’t help suspecting the golden days of this particular journey are over.</p>
<p>And tomorrow – on the last full day of riding of this trip – it’s going to get a whole lot worse.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s already bright when I wake, yet everything is coated in a thick layer of dew. I pack more quickly than ever before. Having so few belongings is a luxury in so many ways.</p>
<p>I ride the final couple of miles to the pass. A man-made chasm in the final wall of rock gives way to the most surreal of views: a coastal panorama from on high, but one in which a blanket of humidity renders the sea itself invisible! Below me, illuminated in fragments by an ascending sun, the road drops away in a squiggle of switchbacks, an unbroken descent from my perch at 1,200m all the way down to sea level.</p>
<p>I shiver as I begin the plunge, but by the time I bottom out on the valley floor I’m sweating and stripping off clothes – a mix of adrenaline and the fact that, through a 20-minute freewheeling session, I’ve flipped the climate on its head. And that’s not all that changes. Emerging onto the main coastal highway is a shock of noise, fumes, trucks and roadside detritus. I’m not going to be on it for long, but I’m determined to get off it as soon as possible. Riding along the debris-ridden shoulder for less than a mile, I’m rewarded with the first and only puncture of the trip, and I stop outside a supermarket to fix it, taking the opportunity to dry out my tent in the sun and guzzle a litre of <em>shir kakao</em> (chocolate milk) – the perfect fuel of the touring cyclist – while I’m getting my hands dirty.</p>
<p>It seems I’ve judged the route well: the highway abandons the coastline here in favour of heading inland, cutting off the corners of the meandering seashore. A&nbsp;minor road plies the scenic route&nbsp;beside&nbsp;the waves, and emerging from the mountains has spat me out right beside the junction. Puncture fixed, I pedal through the sleepy town of Parsian towards the approaching coast. It’s Friday and all but a couple of shops are closed. I stock up on cheap packets of synthetic-tasting banana-flavoured biscuits in case this is the last opportunity to buy food today.</p>
<p>As usual, I have been navigating mainly by intuition on this journey. Prior knowledge of what to expect comes from a quick glance at a map in the morning, a quick memorisation of bearings and landmarks and rough distances. I decide upon no break stops nor daily destinations in advance: I long ago learned that flexibility is the spark that ignites the volatile kind of freedom that comes with travelling by bicycle. The limiting factor on this occasion is time – but all this really means is that I am even more motivated to engage fully with each moment of this journey. As it stands, I’ll have to ride minimum 90-mile daily averages if I’m to pedal every inch of the way to Bandar Abbas and catch the train back to Tehran. But by this stage I am feeling strong, so I’m perfectly OK with a little optimism, even if it will mean super-early mornings and pedalling well into the night.</p>
<p>It’s at the little town of Bostanoo that I finally feel the sea spray on my face. Down by the jetty, a man on a motorbike talks loudly into a mobile phone and ignores me. Otherwise, I am alone among the fishing launches and piles of tangled netting. I dismount and clamber across the rocks, desperate to strip off and dive in, but that would be a major faux pas in a place like this. To my right, a beach of purest white stretches half a mile to the nearby headland, populated only by plastic flotsam. A small military outpost, built in the style of a colonial fortress, overlooks the empty expanse of sand. In the distance I can make out the sun-shelters and gaudy children’s play apparatus of a government-built ‘beach’ complex, where families gather to picnic fully-clothed and gaze occasionally at the sea. But nobody, it seems, is there.</p>
<p>It’s a quiet and predictably anticlimactic moment, a weird juxtaposition of indoctrinated notions of ‘the seaside’ – ice-cream, seagulls, working-class families on day-trips, the apparatus of institutionalised leisure – with the reality that, here, the seaside is just where the land ends. The rules&nbsp;don’t change when you dip your toes in the water.</p>
<p>The breeze… <em>yes</em>. It’s a westerly. It will be following me all day. I am a lucky cyclist indeed.</p>
<p>And before I know it I have cycled fifty miles along a gently undulating, newly-paved road, which I have entirely to myself. The sea never leaves my sight as the sun carves its low arc across the southern sky. My&nbsp;momentum, it seems, has not been interrupted by a mere night under canvas. I stop in a tiny fishing village and visit the mosque for a wash and toilet break. Back on the peaceful road, I wave at the occasional 4×4 full of urbanites seeking secluded beaches for a quiet weekend out of town. At one such paradisiacal sanctuary, I even spot people paddling in the sea.</p>
<p>Soon after Bandar-e Mogham I discover why this new road is so little used: it isn’t finished yet. In place of the smooth asphalt are the half-built foundations of the new road. The bed of crushed rock has been steamrollered flat and would be perfectly good to ride if it weren’t for the enormous trenches that slice the surface into elongated islands bounded at each end by sheer drops. Into each chasm has been placed a huge concrete drainage pipe, but these trenches&nbsp;– big enough to swallow me and my bike whole – have yet to be filled back in. So I do what the pickup drivers and motorbike riders do, at least judging by their tyre marks: use the new surface where it’s possible, and dive off on a detour through the desert where it isn’t. With its narrow tyres, my bike sinks into the soft sand, and I find myself pushing. The whole scene is strangely reminiscent of <a href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/notes-from-afar-the-hottest-place-on-earth/">that time I cycled across the Afar Desert</a>, although without the naked tribespeople, off-the-scale temperatures, and AK-47s.</p>
<p>It’s fun, in a strange kind of way, because it makes the cycling itself an activity worth my attention – the flipside of dirt road bikepacking, when total concentration is demanded and there’s little room left for thoughts to wander. And despite the rapid deceleration that comes with such terrain, I ride on through the sunset, enjoying having this remote patch of tropical coastline to myself, basking in the golden light that bathes the landscape and makes the already magical colours pop, almost psychedelic to the eye in those moments before the sun sinks beneath the ocean, soothing and melancholy thereafter until all has sunk into the deep blue of the night.</p>
<p>By the time the asphalt reappears, I’ve smashed my target&nbsp;and pedalled well over a hundred miles. For some reason, today has felt different, as if I’ve entered a new phase of the journey, and I suppose, by latching myself magnetically to the coastline, it has. Starscape overhead, I’m on a roll, headtorch illuminating the empty road ahead. I keep pedalling.</p>
<p>Passing Bandar-e Aftab – the first real town I’ve seen since the morning – I stop a car and ask the young driver if the town has a beach – yes! – and if it’ll be a problem to camp on it – of course not! It’s another&nbsp;of those days in which everything just clicks, the miles seem effortless, and the experience just flows. And it seems to be ending perfectly.</p>
<p>As it turns out, it&nbsp;ends even more perfectly than I’d bargained for. As I nose between the walls of village homes in search of the beach, I hear an engine gunning rapidly towards me, lights flashing in the gloom, horn honking, and I realise it’s the same lad I’d pulled over a few minutes beforehand. He’s pulled a U-turn on the highway and driven back to Bandar-e Aftab just to tell me there’s a spare room at his family home in which I can sleep! He’s gone so far out of his way to help some cyclist whose face he could barely have seen in the darkness that I accept, for his sake as much as mine. He lets me in and shows me the room.</p>
<p>“Your house is my house,” he says, before getting back in the car and departing again on his original journey. A few minutes later, his father brings me a tray of food, echoes the same sentiment, and I am left to my own devices – which at this late hour involves nothing more than sinking into a deep and well-earned sleep.</p>
