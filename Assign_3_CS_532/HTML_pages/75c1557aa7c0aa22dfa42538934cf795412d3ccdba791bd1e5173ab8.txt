Houston-based 
Phillips 66
 (NYSE: PSX) now expects the heavily contested Dakota Access pipeline project, along with the rest of the infrastructure tied to that system, to enter service in 2017.


The original start date for the project was the fourth quarter of 2016, but 
regulatory delays around a right-of-way permit
 and high-profile protests have 
delayed it thus far
. Now Phillips 66 CEO 
Greg Garland
 expects the project to enter service in the second quarter of this year, he said on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call.

Hall Puckett






















 






The system, a joint venture between Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP (NYSE: ETP), 
Sunoco Logistics Partners LP
 (NYSE: SXL) and Phillips 66, includes Dakota Access and the Energy Transfer Crude Oil pipeline. Both those pipelines will be able to transport up to 450,000 barrels per day of crude oil out of the Bakken and into the companies' storage facilities near Beaumont, Texas.












Notably, the system ties into another joint venture between the same three companies, the Bayou Bridge pipeline, the first leg of which which entered service in 2016. Right now, Bayou Bridge extends the reach of crude that makes its way into the Beaumont storage facilities out to Lake Charles, Louisiana, where Phillips 66 owns a refinery. The companies are working on an extension to that pipeline that would carry crude on to St. 
James Parish
, Louisiana, with an in-service date in the second half of 2017.










 






Phillips 66 is also now working on an expansion to its Beaumont storage terminal, which can store up to 7.1 million barrels of crude oil and refined products, according to the company's website. Phillips 66 is looking to make an additional 2 million barrels of storage available at the terminal by the start of the second half, with plans to eventually expand to 16 million barrels, Garland said.


President Donald Trump 
signed an executive order
 on Dakota Access pushing it forward in January.
