Betsy DeVos was just confirmed as education secretary â here's what she will control

  The Senate confirmed Betsy DeVos as the secretary of education on
  Tuesday in historic fashion, requiring Vice President Mike Pence
  

  to cast the tiebreaking vote
.




  The Senate split 50-50, with every Democratic senator and
  Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of
  Alaska voting to oppose DeVos. It was the first time in US
  history that a vice president has had to cast a tiebreaker vote
  for a Cabinet nominee.




  The vote ended an uncharacteristically contentious confirmation
  process for a secretary of education. The position is typically
  confirmed without major opposition.




  So what exactly does the secretary of education do?




  Education in the US is largely under state and local control, and
  the federal government's role is limited in scope.




  As the head of the US Department of Education, the secretary
  advises and executes legislation over education policy at both
  the K-12 and postsecondary levels.




  "The position of secretary of education is, more than anything,
  an opportunity to be a bully pulpit to express the views of the
  president," 
Paul
  Reville
, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of
  Education, told Business Insider. "The role is highly
  constrained."




  Created in 1979 under President Jimmy Carter, the Education
  Department is the smallest Cabinet-level department. Its main
  functions include administering federal assistance to schools and
  enforcing federal education laws. The secretary of education is
  No. 15 in line to succeed the president.




  Before it became an independent agency, the Education Department
  existed under the scope of what is now known as the Department of
  Health and Human Services â formerly the Department of Health,
  Education, and Welfare.




  A changing political and social environment after World War II
  led to the creation of the department as interest in investing in
  the American educational system increased. The Soviet Union's
  launch of Sputnik in 1957, for example, pushed the US on its
  heels and started the race to close the perceived gap in
  technological capabilities between the USSR and the US.




  Today, the department collects data and does research on student
  outcomes and success, providing national figures that allow for
  comparison among states.




  While school districts get most of their funding from local
  taxes, federal agencies including the Education Department
  
contribute
  about 8%
 to district budgets. The department's Title I
  program, for example, provides funding to schools with large
  numbers of low-income students.




  The department, through its Office for Civil Rights, also handles
  matters related to discrimination in schools and colleges on the
  basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, and other
  characteristics.

  For example, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a 

  complaint
 with the Department of Education in 2014 on behalf
  of Gavin Grimm, a transgender student who said he was
  discriminated against by his school district because it did not
  let him use the bathroom that corresponded with his gender
  identity.




  And in 2015, an alliance of Asian-American groups filed a
  complaint with the department against Harvard University, saying
  Harvard and other Ivy League schools 

  used racial quotas
 that discriminated against Asians in their
  admissions processes.




  The Office for Civil Rights is also responsible for investigating
  violations of Title IX, the federal law that prohibits
  discrimination based on gender in education. The Education
  Department currently has 

  more than 200 open investigations
 into sexual assaults on
  college campuses.




  One of the largest â and certainly the costliest â areas of
  responsibility for the department is administering federal
  student aid. The department spent about 

  $22.5 billion in fiscal 2016
 on the Pell Grant program, which
  provides aid for students that does not need to be repaid. The
  program was the largest area of spending for the department in
  2016.




  In her home state of Michigan, DeVos has championed charter
  school and school-voucher initiatives, but she has not waded into
  issues of higher education. She is the first choice for secretary
  of education without substantial experience in higher education.




  While it's possible to predict some of the issues related to
  primary and secondary schooling that DeVos will support in her
  role, the direction she will take in higher education is less
  apparent. During a confirmation hearing where DeVos was 

  grilled on several issues
, she gave vague answers or said she
  was currently unable to provide a response.
