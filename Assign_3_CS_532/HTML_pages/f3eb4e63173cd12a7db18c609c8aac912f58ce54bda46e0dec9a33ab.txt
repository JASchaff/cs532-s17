Congress: Require Trump to prove he has no Dakota Access Pipeline conflicts of interest -- #NoDAPL



						  Petition by 
						  
Roxanne Saxton




To be delivered to  



The United States House of Representatives and The United States Senate








Petition Statement


Require President Trump to provide the audit trail of papers proving he is no longer involved in any way, shape, or form with the Dakota Access Pipeline. 







	There are currently 236,265 signatures.
		

NEW goal - 
We need 250,000 signatures!
		






















Petition Background




  
   President Trump just signed an executive order that could allow work on the Dakota Access Pipeline to proceedâthreatening the water of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and 17 million people who live and work along the shore of the Missouri River.



Federal disclosure forms filed in May of 2016 showed that President Donald Trump held shares in Energy Transfer Partners and Phillips 66, both part of the DAPL entity. A Trump spokesperson announced--without offering any proof--that he had sold off his shares in Energy Transfer Partners, but not Phillips 66.



Trump's team has claimed he has no conflict of interest, but their word is not enough.



If the President has truly divested, he should easily be able to prove it and put the claim to rest. If he cannot, he has no business signing executive orders that cause conflicts of interest.
