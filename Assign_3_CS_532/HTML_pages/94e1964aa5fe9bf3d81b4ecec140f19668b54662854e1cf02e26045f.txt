Betsy DeVos Confirmed As Education Secretary

If you had any hopes that the Senate would pull through and reject the ridiculously unqualified Betsy DeVos as Education Secretary in the soggy cheeto’s cabinet, your hopes have now been crushed. 
It’s official: Betsy DeVos is the Education Secretary of the United States of America.


The vote in the Senate first concluded in a tie, with all of Democrats, both Independents, and two Republican senators voting against Betsy DeVos. The two brave Republicans who voted against DeVos were Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, citing her lack of qualifications and public influence as reasons for their votes. The remainder of the Republicans voted in favor of her taking over the position, thus leaving the vote 50/50. And if you remember anything from your high school government class, you know that the person appointed to break a tie in the Senate is none other than the vice president.


Of course. Who else to make the final decision of the future of our nation’s public education than Trump’s gay-hating puppet? As expected, Pence voted in favor of DeVos, officially appointing her to the cabinet position.


Many took to Twitter to voice their outrage and discontent with the situation.




This is a major blow to education. Not only is Betsy DeVos unqualified, but she is a total enemy to the public school system.

Betsy Devos got confirmed. Everyone who voted for her should be ashamed. Party before country. They’re using children’s education as pawns.

Senator Al Franken of Minnesota called the vote “the most embarrassing confirmation hearing I have ever seen.”

Many are concerned about DeVos’ inexperience with public schools as well as her controversial advocation of 
school vouchers
. As more and more of Trump’s cabinet picks become confirmed, we’ll continue to gain insights into the future of our country, and right now, it’s not looking too hot. I think we can all agree that these next four years couldn’t go by any faster.
