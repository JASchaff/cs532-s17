The renowned schools. The panoramic beauty and proximity to Manhattan. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here, too. I know Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill, and Carroll Gardens intimately because I was born here and have made finding your home in the Heights my business for more than 30 years.\r\n\r\nI am an independent real-estate broker, and I\u2019ve made that independence the hallmark of my 30-year career. I don\u2019t join the open-house parade or display dozens of properties on our site in the hope that one might suit you. I open the door to a select group of distinctive homes that meet your family\u2019s needs and aspirations.\r\n\r\nMy long-time clients depend on my knowledge and experience in Brooklyn real estate to find the one home that meets their needs and aspirations. On behalf of those clients, I have successfully sold many of the finest homes and apartments in Brooklyn Heights and Brownstone Brooklyn.\r\n\r\nI was born and raised in Brooklyn Heights, and my business is built on the loyalty, friendships and trust I have earned over the years. My clients, public personalities or neighborhood friends, depend on my discretion and my respect for their privacy. I have had the good fortune to forge relationships with many families over the decades, now with children following their parents as my clients. Because I have found a place in the lives of the families who are the heart of Brownstone Brooklyn, I have led the market in home sales for decades.\r\n\r\nAs an independent broker, I can follow my instincts in a range of real-estate opportunities. For example, I have consulted with and represented many Brooklyn institutions buying and selling real estate, including Brooklyn Law School, Poly Technical, Grace Church, Brooklyn Catholic Diocese and Trinity Church. I have also sold commercial property in the Heights and surrounding neighborhoods. I successfully represent the grand mansions that periodically come available as well as the quality condo and co-op market, and occasional finer rentals. My knowledge and experience with homes in the Heights have proven helpful to developers and homeowners before and during construction and renovation.\r\n\r\nMy career\u2019s primary reward has been the relationships I\u2019ve formed with customers and friends, whether the leaders of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions, partners in global law firms, entertainment and media personalities \u2014 or the neighbors I\u2019ve helped move as their families have grown and prospered. Each real-estate transaction contains a story, and my career represents a rich, deep volume on life in Brownstone Brooklyn.

Karen and Elizabeth are top producers at Brown Harris Stevens, New York City\u2019s oldest and most prestigious residential real estate firm and the exclusive New York City affiliate of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate\r\n\r\nKaren began her career as a lawyer, first with a Wall Street law firm and then in the legal department of a major financial institution. Eventually she moved from the legal department to the corporate real estate department of a large commercial bank where she was responsible for site selection, and the negotiation and implementation of economic development incentives for the Bank\u2019s global portfolio.\r\n\r\nKaren\u2019s passion for residential real estate began when she and her husband bought their first coop on the Upper West Side in the 1970\u2019s. It developed over the years as she negotiated additional purchases and sales of apartments, vacation properties, and investment properties. She brings her wealth of experience in selecting and renovating undervalued properties to the challenge of finding the right property for each individual buyer. And she delivers exceptional results for sellers through her approach to strategic pricing, creative marketing, and tenacious negotiation. Her background as an attorney enables her to guide both buyers and sellers through the often complex and demanding real estate sales process. Her professionalism has earned her the respect of her clients and colleagues and created a strong referral-based business.\r\n\r\nKaren is a member of the Real Estate Board of New York and has served on the Board of Directors of her cooperative apartment building. In her leisure time, she spends time at her vacation home in Shelter Island where she is an active member of the Shelter Island Yacht Club and participates in both one-design racing and coastal cruising.\r\n\r\nBorn and raised in New York City, Elizabeth applies her vast knowledge of the neighborhoods, schools, attractions, and services throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn to every real estate transaction.\r\n\r\nPrior to joining Brown Harris Stevens, Elizabeth spent a decade working in the art world at several Manhattan fine art galleries, as well as in fundraising and event planning for non-profit arts organizations. She holds degrees from Connecticut College and Sotheby's Institute of Art in London, and also studied art and architecture at Cornell University in Rome, Italy. Elizabeth is a member of the Real Estate Board of New York (REBNY) and The International Real Estate Federation (FIABCI-USA).\r\n\r\nElizabeth currently lives in DUMBO, Brooklyn with her husband and son. She serves on the Board of The Paper Bag Players, one of the oldest children\u2019s theater groups in the country, and is actively involved with Brooklyn Bridge Park Conservancy and Plymouth Church School. In her free time she enjoys spending time at her family home on Shelter Island, skiing, sailing, and traveling.","tagline":"","distance":0,"match_score":11.529,"booking_hotel_id":"","email":"ejohnson@bhsusa.com"}};

            <p>The president&#8217;s January executive order that banned travelers from seven countries from entering the United States has affected Brooklyn in myriad ways, tearing apart families, causing <a href="https://www.brownstoner.com/brooklyn-life/bodega-strike-yemeni-nyc-trump-travel-immigration-ban/">massive protests</a>, and putting immigrant communities here on edge.</p>
<p>Now, the Brooklyn Museum and Brooklyn Community Foundation are holding a panel to get in-depth perspective on the issue from the leaders of groups who work for immigrant interests every day.</p>
