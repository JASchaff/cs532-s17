DeKalb Superintendent Steve Green says socioeconomic improvements will benefit inner-city school districts.
























DeKalb County School District officials said immediately after Betsy DeVos was confirmed as the next U.S. Secretary of Education that she should join school districts in providing “foundational elements” needed for students to succeed.












DeVos, 
a school choice advocate
, was confirmed Tuesday after Vice President Mike Pence broke a 50-50 tie, the first time a vice president has had to break a tie on a cabinet nomination. 




“We ask Secretary DeVos to lead a transformation in solving the most serious problem facing public schools today, a real and growing need for dedicated services and programs that help address the consequences of poverty,” Superintendent Steve Green said in the statement, mentioning nutrition, health and family instability.




Other metro Atlanta school districts said they had no comment or never responded to requests for comment on DeVos’ confirmation.




As poverty rates continue to climb, the needs become greater, Green has said previously. 




A 2011 survey by Adopt A Classroom, which helps provide resources to teachers across the country, found 91 percent of teachers it surveyed reported buying food and clothing for their students. Various studies point to hungry children being unable to learn. 




According to the National Center for Education Statistics, more than half the country’s public school children are on 
free or reduced lunch
.












“It’s time to bring together resources … and resourceful collaboration,” Green said, “to support socioeconomic improvements that boost schools and students.”
























The Senate confirmation process typically includes all cabinet-level officials and hundreds of other senior positions. (Erica A. Hernandez/AJC)
