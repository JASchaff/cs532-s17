Trump, Pence, and Bannon: Resign Now

President Donald Trump

Petition Background




  
   In the course of the most disastrous and alarming first days of any presidency in our nation's history, Donald Trump's administration has ... 



 - blocked health care to millions of women around the world, 

 - threatened to close down all federal domestic violence programs,

  - appointed an apparent white nationalist to the White House staff and the National Security Council,

 - on Holocaust Remembrance Day, failed to mention the Nazi regime's Jewish victims,

 - also on Holocaust Remembrance Day, issued a blanket travel ban against citizens of majority Muslim countries, causing panic around the world and affecting around 90,000 refugees, dual passport holders, and U.S. permanent residents, then firing the acting Attorney General when she refused to defend the ban,

 - carelessly turned the goodwill of the Mexican and Chinese governments into animosity,

 - been in violation of the Constitution's emoluments clause, which forbids elected officials from accepting any kind of payment or consideration from foreign governments, from his first day in office,

 - used legislative branch staff do work for the executive branch without telling Congress,

 - rolled back an interest rate cut for homeowners,

 - gone back on his promise to negotiate lower prescription drug prices,

 - forbidden civil servants from communicating with the media or the public regarding their work and research,

 - threatened the media and called for journalists who report on the administration's dishonesty to be fired,

 - and directed the Department of Homeland Security to begin construction of a wasteful, destructive wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.



That's only the beginning, and it's not even a complete list of this administration's offenses against decency.



Donald Trump's administration is a disgrace, even without considering his extensive known and suspected ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and other white nationalists at home and abroad. The administration is a disgrace even without considering Trump's praise of brutal authoritarian leaders in Turkey, India, and the Phillippines, on the basis of their murderous crackdowns on ethnic and religious minorities, the press, peaceful demonstrators, and the poor.



Resign, Mr. Trump. Go home. And take your friends with you.
