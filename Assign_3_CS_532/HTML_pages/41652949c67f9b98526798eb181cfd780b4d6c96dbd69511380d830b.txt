It's starting to feel like every show this year is going to have music inspired or shaped in some way by social and political unrest. This week, that means a dark and gritty new cut about greed and corruption from 
The Black Angels
, and singer 
David Bazan
's (relatively) uplifting plea for empathy in his new song, "Care."
 
But we've also got plenty of other music to lift you up, including the wistful but celebratory new song from 
Future Islands
 called "Ran," and an epic, shape-shifting rock cut from the Athens, Ga. band Oak House. NPR Music's Lars Gotrich and Marissa Lorusso stop by the studio to turn us on to a couple of their favorite new discoveries, including some pure pop joy from a New York group called 
Charly Bliss
, and the Japanese experimental psych-rock band 
Sundays & Cybele
.
 
Bob also shares some arresting ear-candy from the Polish composer 
Jacaszek
 and the English singer-songwriter 
Johnny Flynn
.
 
But we begin the show with some 
good news
: "When the sun dies, the charred, lifeless remains of Earth will leave no evidence that humanity ever existed at all!"

The Black Angels




Song:
 Currency


from
 Death Song




Heavy psych rarely feels as fresh as it does with 
Tiny Desk
 veterans The Black Angels, who know how to shred. The band's first new album in four years is 
Death Song
, a play on a classic 
Velvet Underground
 track.
 
"Currency" takes on the topic of money's role in a world that's bought and sold by a select few. 
Death Song
 comes out on Partisan April 21.

David Bazan




Song:
 Care


from
 Care




David Bazan is back with his third full-length album in less than a year. The title track from 
Care 
is a moody slow burner, intended as a message of hope and unity. Bazan, who says he spent the last year performing protest songs, decided to make a plea for empathy with this release. "I found myself in an unfamiliar mode," he tells us, "trying to light a candle. The song 'Care' is the first one I lit." 
Care
 comes out March 7 via Undertow.

Charly Bliss




Song:
 Glitter


from
 Guppy




"Glitter," from the New York-based Charly Bliss, juxtaposes dark themes with joyful melodies and saccharine vocals. Charly Bliss' debut album, 
Guppy
 comes out April 21 on Barsuk.

Sundays & Cybele




Song:
 Chaos & Systems


from
 Chaos & Systems




NPR Music's Japanese psych expert Lars Gotrich shares a song premiere from the Tokyo-based freak-out act Sundays & Cybele. The group
 
exercises unusual restraint on the title track of their upcoming album, which glides along the rails of a incessant kalimba beat. Guitarist and vocalist Kazuo Tsubouchi considers the chromatic tune a sort of rice planter song and a prayer for fertility. 
Chaos & Systems
 is out on February 24 via Beyond Beyond is Beyond.

Oak House




Song:
 Esque


from
 Hot or Mood




Take in the mercurial swirl of the Athens GA-based rock band Oak House in this premiere from the group's upcoming debut. Frontman Gresham Cash says this epic jam was inspired by a Kafka-esque dream. Over its nearly six-minute course, "Esque" defies expectations with frenetic shifts in mood and energy. Oak House's 
Hot Or Mood
 comes out April 7.

Jacaszek




Song:
 Soft Music


from
 KWIATY




Inspired by an anthology of 17th century metaphysical poetry, Polish electroacoustic composer Jacaszek returns with a record titled 
KWIATY
. Here, we premiere the frail and affecting "Soft Music." Though it may feel like a trek across an arctic plane, this tune is as buoyant and vocal-driven as any in Jacaszek's career. Combining fragments from years past, the artist crafts a gorgeous blend of sounds. 
KWIATY
 comes out March 17 via Ghostly International.

Johnny Flynn




Song:
 Heart Sunk Hank


from
 Sillion




London luminary Johnny Flynn returns with "Heart Sunk Hank," recorded in part on one of two working 
voice-o-graphs
 in the world. The resulting crackle effect, alongside the breezy intonation of this achingly beautiful self-duet, captures an English folk tradition of days past. Flynn's fourth record, 
Sillion
, is out March 24 on Transgressive.
