RuPaul’s Drag Race
 is going harder than 
Coco Montrese’s contour
: 
Lady Gaga
 announced via Twitter Tuesday that she will appear on the reality competition’s upcoming season 9 premiere.


“The time has come! I’m joining the girls on the season premiere of 
@RuPaulsDragRace
!” Gaga tweeted, while also hash-tagging the lyrics #DontBeADrag #JustBeAQueen from her 2011 hit “Born This Way.”

In a short preview clip posted alongside Gaga’s tweet, Mother Monster, who literally dropped the mic during 
one of the most-watched Super Bowl halftime shows of all time
 last Sunday, is seen greeting the season 9 queens in the storied work room, where she recites RuPaul’s signature well-wishing line, “May the best woman win.”


In August 2013, Gaga first expressed interest on Twitter about joining the show as a judge. “Can I PLEASE be a judge on drag race! @RuPaul I started out in these club, these women taught me how to serve!” she tweeted.






Can I PLEASE be a judge on drag race! 
@RuPaul
 I started out in these club, these women taught me how to serve!

This is not the first time Gaga and RuPaul have collaborated. The drag icon also joined the Oscar-nominated singer-songwriter during her 2013 television special 
Lady Gaga and the Muppets Holiday Spectacular, 
performing a duet
 of the 
Artpop
 cut “Fashion!”


Gaga’s music and likeness have also appeared in past 
Drag Race
 episodes. Season 8’s Naysha Lopez memorably lost her place in the competition 
for not knowing the lyrics
 to the smash single “Applause” during a lip-sync performance, and multiple queens have portrayed the pop star for the show’s long-running Snatch Game impersonation challenge  — some 
more successfully
 than 
others
.


Last week, 
Logo revealed the 13 fierce queens
 set to compete for the title of America’s Next Drag Superstar across the reality show’s ninth edition, including Trinity Taylor, who defeated 
Drag Race
 graduate Alyssa Edwards
 at the 2014 National Entertainer of the Year pageant in Louisville, Kentucky, and London native Charlie Hides, who hops across the pond to join the lineup.


Logo previously confirmed the season 9 opener will feature a shocking moment “that will go down as one of the most jaw-dropping moments in 
Drag Race
 history,” per a press release.


After turning the show into a worldwide phenomenon, RuPaul won his first Emmy for hosting the series — which first premiered in 2009 — in September.


RuPaul’s Drag Race
 season 9 premieres this March on Logo.
