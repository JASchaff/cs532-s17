U.S. President 
Donald Trump
’s key advisor may be pushing for World War 3, thinks Shane Croucher, contributing author at 
the International Business Times
.
The mention of World War 3 has popped up in the media too frequently recently:
Former U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron warned that Brexit could destroy the European Union and unleash a new war;
European Council President Donald Tusk warned that Brexit threatens ‘Western political civilization’;
The last leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, said on Monday that it “all looks” as if the world is “preparing” for World War 3;
U.S. President Donald Trump accused Republicans John McCain and Lindsey Graham on Sunday of trying to spark World War 3;
Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, who was recently given a seat on the National Security Council of the U.S., believes there’s already a “major war brewing, a war that’s already global.”

This very chilling tendency shows that world leaders and influential political figures might know something that 7 billion other people, most of whom have lived peacefully since the end of World War 2, don’t know. And while President Trump accuses McCain and Graham of provoking World War 3, there might be someone close to the U.S. President who’s actually pushing for war, according to Croucher.
Bannon: “A very brutal and bloody conflict” – World War 3
While the U.S. President warns the senators against “looking to start World War 3,” someone who’s standing right next to him – his chief strategist and advisor Bannon – thinks global war has already begun.
World War 3 fears have been around for the past few years, lurking in the shadows and making major headlines. We’ve seen the global financial crisis; the spread of terrorism and constant terror attacks in major European states; failed military campaigns in the Middle East; North Korea’s nuclear program; China’s provocative naval activities in the South China Sea; Russia’s annexation of Crimea and its appetites in Eastern Europe; nuclear-armed Pakistan and India’s engaging in chilling military battles on their border; the unpredictable consequences of the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union; and Trump’s presidency… just to name a few concerns.
So clearly, there have been plenty of factors and signals that have made the entire world worry about its peaceful future. Bannon said earlier that the world has spiraled into a crisis that could trigger “a very brutal and bloody conflict,” or in other words – World War 3.
 
 
 
 
Bannon urges the world to unite against “Islamic fascism”
Bannon, who was a vocal supporter of Trump during his presidential campaign, now has enormous power and influence in the U.S. He is convinced that the world is experiencing dramatic changes, putting its “Judeo-Christian” value system on the brink of ruin. Addressing a conference in the Vatican held by the Human Dignity Institute in 2014, 
Bannon
 declared that “we are in an outright war against jihadist Islamic fascism.”
“And this war is, I think, metastasizing far quicker than governments can handle it.”
Saying that the world is “at the very beginning stages of a very brutal and bloody conflict,” Bannon warned that unless the world stands united “against this new barbarity that’s starting,” terrorism “will completely eradicate everything that we’ve been bequeathed over the last 2,000, 2,500 years.”
Did Bannon personally spearhead Trump’s Muslim ban?
Bannon is believed to have been the driving force behind some of the most controversial orders by Trump since assuming office. The most notable one is, of course, the executive order temporarily barring immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S.
According to 
CNN’s sources
, Bannon personally spearheaded the controversial executive order and choked off remarks from the Department of Homeland Security that could have softened the order.
A few days later, Trump got Bannon a seat at the National Security Council table in a shakeup of his key advising group on foreign policy. Bannon earlier said the world will “unfortunately” have to face a global war “very quickly.”
“…there is a major war brewing, a war that’s already global. It’s going global in scale, and today’s technology, today’s media, today’s access to weapons of mass destruction, it’s going to lead to a global conflict that I believe has to be confronted today,” Bannon said.
Bannon on access to nuclear weapons
Bannon also spoke out about access to “weapons of mass destruction,” something Trump recently got hold of after assuming office. In his first interview after being sworn in as President on January 20, Trump confessed that having access to the U.S. nuclear arsenal is “very, very scary” but stressed that he would have no problem 
pushing the button, should the time come
.
Less than a week after Trump became President, the Doomsday Clock, which determines how close the world is to a global catastrophe, including World War 3, was 
moved forward by 30 seconds
 to just 2:30 minutes away from “midnight,” the closest it has been to it since 1953 when both the U.S. and Soviet Union fired hydrogen bombs as part of nuclear tests.
“Every day that we refuse to look at this as what it is, and the scale of it, and really the viciousness of it, will be a day where you will rue that we didn’t act,” Bannon added.
What is Bannon whispering into Trump’s ear?
Some political experts continue to speculate about which countries Trump could add to his infamous 
Muslim ban
 list next, while others believe the controversial executive order could actually have the opposite effect and inspire terrorists to prove to Trump that he underestimated them.
Since 9/11, there have been 48 attacks of jihadist violence across the United States, which have resulted in the deaths of 139 Americans. Since 2015, there have been a total of 35 terrorist attacks across Europe. In December 2016 alone, terrorist attacks in 27 countries around the world claimed the lives of 1,378 people and injured 1,737 others, according to 
Military.com
.
So is Bannon right when he says the world is already waging an undeclared global war? And is Bannon whispering his warnings about the imminent World War 3 into Trump’s ear?
