DeVos Confirmed As Education Secretary After Pence Casts First Ever VP Tiebreaking Vote

As 
previewed earlier
, in a vote that many had expected would end up deadlocked 50/50 in the Senate, moments ago the confirmation vote for Trump's Education Secretary candidate Besty DeVos was indeed tied in the Senate after two Republicans - Collins and Murkowski voted against -  which then prompted Vice President Mike Pence to cast the first ever tie-breaking vote for a cabinet nominee in Senate history, in the process confirming DeVos as America's new Secretary of Education.


BREAKING: Vice President Mike Pence casts the tie-breaking vote to confirm Betsy DeVos as education secretary

The last time a VP broke a tie in the Senate was 2008, when then-Vice President Dick Cheney voted on a tax adjustment plan. 


And Pence is on the Senate floor, preparing to break the 50-50 tie.

BREAKING: Senate CONFIRMS 
@BetsyDeVos
 to be Pres Trump's Sec of Education, 51-50, after 
@VP
 Pence came to Capitol to break the 50-50 tie.

As expected, 
@BetsyDeVos
 was confirmed 51-50, with 
@VP
 Pence breaking the tie.


GOP 'NO' VOTES:
Collins
Murkowski


DEM 'YES' VOTES:
None.

The broken tie by 
@VP
 Pence to confirm 
@BetsyDeVos
 marks the 1st time a VP has broken a tie for a cabinet nom in the history of the Senate.

Prior to the vote, Chuck Schumer made a failed 11th-hour plea Tuesday morning for a third Republican to buck DeVos and sink her nomination. “It’s the Republican side demanding a vote for an unqualified candidate,” the Senate’s top Democrat said. “I hope against hope that another Republican will have the courage … [to] join us.” 


Schumer suggested Republicans are privately saying they wish Trump picked someone else, calling DeVos a “negative trifecta.”


Democrats forced a rare all-night session to try to rally public support behind their opposition to DeVos’s nomination, including protesting outside of the Capitol with progressive groups.  In retrospect it was all for nothing. 



And another piece of historical trivia: DeVos just got the most “no” votes of any education secretary in history.

The only way the Democrats could’ve “killed” DeVos was to sneak in a few corpses and a dozen of illegal aliens into the Senate Chamber to vote against her.


 


The final tally would’ve been 50-67 out of 100, but who cares? It has worked for them in the past and it would’ve worked now, too.

Each kid in the LAUSD (Los Angeles Unified School District) costs $13K per year!   For a 'small' class of 25, that's $325,000 a year, for ONE class room!  Pay the teacher $50K and there's still $275,000 left over!!!  Somebody told me that in DC, it's $20K a year, per student (and we all know the results on that one...).

Exactly. I've decided to follow the twitter feed of Kamala Harris, the idiot moonbat Dem Senator extraordinaire from California. This dolt is talking about Trump 'ruining California's education'. That's like trying to ruin Hiroshima 24 hours after the Little Boy was dropped.


Anyway, for fun, I decided to look at who funded this imbecile's election. Tons of cash from the Federal and State teacher's union. Color me shocked.

The only way she could be even remotely considered "controversial" is she did what the Teacher's Union didn't do, educate poor kids.  The days of these unions sucking the host dry are coming to an end.   When we have an education system that gives credit for putting 2+2=5 and can mark wrong  a question where the student 6+6=12, you know things have gone off the deep end into more liberal insanity.

It's not the only way, but it's certainly 200% better than what we have now.


The bottom line is, once people have other options than state schools, the state schools will be in deep trouble, fast. Further, the ability of politicians to buy support through education sinecures will come to an end.

all the gop loved that and all it did was fuck shit up. 


the teachers unions are not to blame for bad teachers.  blame the administrators and district for doing the hiring and the firing, and for everyone allowing it.   Our culture/society that devalues education is what is at fault.


AMERICANS, we have a   saying, accepted as truth,  that says "those who can't do, teach".  


That is HEART of the problem,  it is actually, "those who can do, were taught."

"Competition", "Choice", "Charter", "Voucher"etc......  these are terms meant to obfuscate the real agendas. 


There has been an OVERT and COVERT WAR on educating Americans for the last 40 years.   at least. 


The oligarchs in the USA do not want an educated populace, they want easily confused, manipulated, and controlled citizens. 


When we devalue, defund, and pork barrel waste on education are you surprised at the results?   Don't blame the teachers unions for bad teachers.  Blame the ones doing the hiring and firing: the administrators, the districts, the boards.  


AMERICANS, we need to look in the mirror deep and hard when we have a  saying, accepted as truth,  that says "those who can't do, teach".  


That is HEART of the problem,  it is actually, "those who can do were taught."   


When a society/culture so little respects education that a warm body is given a classroom key, that is a bad sign.  


NO OTHER country that leads in education is pursuing this path.  And we have been marching down this path for 20-30 years.


NO OTHER countrty would waste generations on a "give it a chance" approach.  On something known to not work.


why aren't we doing what actually works????   look around, we are alone on this and for good reason.
