Lady Gaga Gets Emotional With Her Family After Super Bowl Set (PHOTO)



We weren't the only ones overjoyed with Lady Gaga's Super Bowl LI halftime set!



Feb  7, 2017







We weren't the only ones overjoyed with Lady Gaga's Super Bowl LI halftime set on Sunday (February 5) as seen in new backstage shots of Mother Monster and her family.


In new photos of her backstage of the NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, the Lady is seen hugging her mother, father and sister after her pop spectacle. Always a family-oriented gal, the star showed some love to her parents when she gave them a brief shout out during the "Million Reasons" portion of her 13-minute performance. It goes to show practice pays off as the explosive set saw the singer perfectly jump off the stadium roof ledge and drive 5.1 million mentions on the Twitterverse.


Gaga has plenty to celebrate after her hits-filled set on Super Bowl Sunday. Not only is her catalogue still atop the iTunes chart, but she also announced details and dates for her "Joanne World Tour," which kicks off in August. Click here for further details.
