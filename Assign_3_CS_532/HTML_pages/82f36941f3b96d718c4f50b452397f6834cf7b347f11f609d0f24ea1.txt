  The Senate confirmed Betsy DeVos as the secretary of education on
  Tuesday in historic fashion, requiring Vice President Mike Pence
  to cast the tiebreaking vote.


  The Senate split 50-50, with every Democratic member and
  Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of
  Alaska voting to oppose DeVos. Pence's vote was the first time in
  US history that a vice president has had to cast a tiebreaker for
  a Cabinet nominee.


  The vote ended an uncharacteristically contentious confirmation
  process for a secretary of education. Typically, the position is
  confirmed without major opposition.


  But DeVos' nomination elicited strong public outrage, spurring
  thousands of calls from constituents to their senators. Protests
  in opposition to her nomination cropped up around the US, and
  Democratic lawmakers on Monday 

  held a marathon late-night session to oppose DeVos
.


  An 

  advocate for alternatives
 to traditional public schooling,
  DeVos championed charter schools and school-voucher initiatives
  in her home state of Michigan, where she served as chairwoman of
  the Michigan Republican Party.










  Democrats have argued that she is unqualified to be secretary of
  education, a view that centered on a confirmation hearing in
  which DeVos was 

  grilled on several issues
 and often gave vague answers or
  said she was currently unable to provide a response. In perhaps
  the most widely circulated exchange, when asked about guns on
  school campuses, DeVos noted that guns could "protect from
  potential grizzlies."


  Still, most Republicans in the Senate stand behind DeVos. "She's
  been on the forefront of the most important education issues,"
  Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said on Tuesday,
  citing her contributions to the school-choice movement.
