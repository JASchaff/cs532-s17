If You Are An Immigrant (even a US Citizen), Here Are 9 Things You Should Know















Are you a Naturalized U.S. Citizen, Lawful Permanent
Resident, Visa Holder, or an Undocumented Immigrant? We recommend you take the following steps to protect yourself in our current version of America.







The last couple of weeks have reminded immigrants, even
naturalized U.S. citizens, that they were not born in the United States. Our
office has received countless phone calls, emails, and social media messages
from people worrying about what their family’s future in the United States
holds. 







Most people want to know what they can do now to protect themselves from what promises to be a wave of anti-immigration activity by the federal government. Trump's 
Executive Order on Interior Enforcement
 has some provisions that should make most Americans shiver.  We recommend the following actions for each of the following groups:












Naturalized U.S. citizens.
 In particular
if you have a foreign accent, and you are traveling 
within 100 miles of any US Border
 (including the oceans), we strongly recommend carrying with you your US passport, or passport card, or a
photocopy of your naturalization certificate. Because of the unpredictability of the current situation, we recommend keeping a photocopy of these documents in a safe place
at your home, so that if necessary, someone will have access to it.  You may very well need to prove your US Citizenship. 


 
Permanent residents.
 Most people don't know this, but federal law requires that anyone who is NOT a US Citizen is required to carry with them at all times, evidence of their lawful status. You can see that for yourself at 
8 USC 1304(e).
   So, carry your green
card with you at all times! You should also keep a photocopy of your green card in a safe place
at home so that it can be accessed by someone in case you lose your card and you need it to identify yourself.  
Don't forget about that 100 mile constitution free zone
!   You should also renew your green card a full 6 months before expiration.  Don't wait!  If your green card has expired, renew it now. And, if it is not obvious at this point, you should start the process to naturalize immediately!  


Lawfully present nonimmigrants (e.g. DACA, U Visa, EADs, Visitors, Students, H1Bs, etc.).
 Carry with you at all times your Employment
Authorization Document, I-94 card, passport with entry stamp, or other proof of
lawful presence (see the law above). Carry the original with you and keep a photocopy in a safe
place at home, especially if you are within the 100 mile border area (more than 60% of the US population lives in this zone).  


Undocumented immigrants in the US for more than
two years.
 Keep with you at all times evidence that you have been present
for at least two years. Why?  Because President Trump just ordered DHS to examine activating a never used provision in immigration law that allows for the immediate removal from the US of anyone who cannot prove they have been here for two years (absent a claim for asylum).  We do not know when ICE or CBP might activate the change, but we need to be prepared.  Evidence that you might want with you are utility bills, receipts, Facebook posts, mail or any other documentation with your
name going back two years, BUT, be very careful of using pay stubs if you have used false documents or information to get your job, as those are prosecutable offenses.  Again you should also keep this information at home so that it is accessible to someone who can help you.  Keep a photocopy at home. And, make sure you have a family plan in place to call for legal assistance if you fail to return home as usual.  


Undocumented immigrants in the US for less than two years.  
The bad news is that you need a plan in place on what will happen to your belongings and your family if you do not return home from work, shopping, or school.  Make sure your relatives know they can look for your name on the 
ICE detainee website
.  
We assume that ICE and CBP will not release you on bond, and that if you have a fear or returning home, you will need to be VERY vocal about letting everyone know if you are detained.


Undocumented Immigrants with 10 years in the United States and children
.  You are eligible for Cancellation of Removal, and release on bond.  Begin now to prepare the paperwork you will need to secure a bond, and to prove your case.  
You can read more about this process here
. Don't be caught unprepared!  


Non-US Citizens (Permanent Residents, Visa Holders, and Undocumented Immigrants) who have a criminal convictions OR are arrested
.  If you have a criminal conviction, or are even arrested for a crime, ICE has begun to detain people in this category and has released only a very few on bond. If you have relief from removal, you are eligible for bond, but, depending on where you are, you may not be released.  Prepare for this by saving money for bond now, and have the paperwork organized so that our attorneys can quickly help seek a bond.   


Undocumented Immigrants with prior deportation orders.  
If you have a prior deportation order and have returned to the United States, you are subject to prosecution by the federal government for the crime of reentry after deportation.  President Trump has ordered his U.S. Attorneys to increase the number of people charged with this crime. Depending on WHY you were deported (for example a serious criminal offense), you can spend up to five years in federal prison for reentering the US.  Again, make your plans now about how you want to deal with this situation. If you have a deportation order and never left, NOW is the time to speak to an immigration attorney and seek advice about your options to reopen your deportation case.  


For those Arrested by ICE, especially for the undocumented
--Have a plan in place. Decide now who picks up the kids from school/daycare, who
will be authorized to do so with the school, who to contact first, have a power of attorney prepared for this.  In the
last few weeks we have heard of parents being picked up at school bus stops and
at work and home while the kids are in school. Once it happens, there is no
time to make arrangements.































Also, do your research now into immigration attorneys that
you may call in a moment’s notice. Keep their phone number handy and ready for
family and friends to use.  Or better yet, go see an excellent immigration attorney now and see what options you may have available to you.  











We give these warnings because we want people to be prepared NOT scared.  Preparation will ensure that your family is protected. Contact us a 404-816-8611 or ckuck@immigration.net or jgavilanes@immigration.net, if you have any questions or concerns regarding your status.

I resent being told as a permanent resident to naturalize now. That man is not going to intimidate me into doing something I have not done for more than 20 years in the US. It is way easier for me to travel with a passport and green card than it would be with a US passport, especially now with our president making no friends in other countries. If my legitimacy in this country is questioned, then I will fight.

So you would rather put yourself through unnecessary hell instead of taking the advise given here? Do you understand that you are not anymore protected than someone who just became a legal resident? 20 years doesn't mean a citizen. Don't ve foolish! Don't try to fight when the current status isn't in your favor. After 20 years you may feel like a citizen just as much as someone who's born here but your documents say otherwise. Take this golden advise and protect yourself.

Susan, I couldn't agree more with you on this! I'm glad I didn't naturalize years ago as soon as I could have. My Euro passport seems to be worth more than an American at the moment. I hate this kind of fear mongering. I'm a productive member of society, so if they don't want me here unless I'm a citizen, I'm not sure how comfortable I feel being here. Yes, this is definitely questioning our legitimacy, which I find quite disturbing. The US is slowly but surely isolating itself.

Of course, you guys have your reasons and I absolutely respect that. However, having another passport such as a European passport to me doesn't seem like a good enough justification. If you naturalize, you will get full rights to protect yourself and your families (yes because if you can't be present this will affect your family considerably) from these crazy and racist measures this administration is taking. YOu can also partuicipate in the decisions that affect your life such as being able to vote and then depending on your country of citizenship, you may continue being a citizen of that country after becoming an American citizen, so you can have the best of both world. Having a US and a European passport sounds like a pretty amazing deal to me. My point is look at your options and make an informed decision, lwas change... dual citizenship is quite common. Now, if you've already done your research and you know you'd have to give up your current citizenship then that is another case. I'm not here to tell you what to do, but to suggest you look at pros and cons.

Susan, I'm not an attorney and i can only share my personal experience. There are several countries which allow dual citizenship.  I never lost the citizenship from the country where i was born. Again, I'm not an attorney but most countries will not revoke your citizenship if you were born there. I also have friends I the same situation.  Depending on what's more "convenient" I / we could use either passport. For the most part US citizens can easily get into most countries but there are some where the other comes handy 😉 with this evil man in charge is safer to naturalize.

I appreciate this advise and it so needed for so many because America is a land of immigrants.  Even The President and his wife are immigrants.  That being said as an immigrant it is not my right to be here so I guess I always knew in the back of my mind a time would could come like this because i can see how this world is spiraling in hate and fear. I am a permanent resident with a green card but my husband is a citizen and my children were born here in America.  I feared this more when my kids were little but now that they are grown, I don't really fret as much.  I am prepared for whatever Trump wants to do, and I am not fear filled or worried. The thing is America is not heaven and no place on this earth is going to be heaven for me.  I just know that wherever I find myself I will make the most of it and will be more than okay.  I am not going to live in fear or repining.  I am going to take life as it comes and bloom wherever I am planted.  That is where is my heart and mind is today.

ADVICE FOR IMMIGRANTS TO USA 
This is an excellent brief advisory on being an immigrant in the US of A, and applies whatever category -- whether you are a citizen, legal resident or unauthorised.  
In these times of a President who appears to be anti-immigrant it helps to be prepared in case the worst thing happens.  
One could almost simply just apply the article to the UK/European immigration situation.
One thing that could be added is to get the migrants' respective families, Embassies and countries to be prepared for the potentially huge influx of returned (deported) citizens and the impact on everything and everyone.

I'm an US permanent resident and not born in any of the 7 countries that were listed in the travel ban. I had traveled to Libya in 2002, for 3 weeks on some business. That is 14 years back. This is will before I came to US for the first time as I came to the USA in 2006. Does the travel ban impacts only the citizens of the 7 affected countries or the people who visited to these 7 countries also get affected ? If the EO doesn't talks anything in matter, by considering that I have traveled to Libya in 2002, what do you advice on travelling outside US at this time ?

The return question is what, exactly is the crime for which the person who is arrested?  If a person is an LPR, then a mere arrest cannot lead to deportation, BUT a mere arrest can result in extended questioning at the airport when returning because of the different standards between deportation and exclusion. We strongly recommend NOT traveling while a criminal case is pending

Hello, for K1 visa holders who already married a US citizen and are waiting to hear back from USCIS about the status of application for permanent residence, will the marriage certificate suffice as proof of legal presence if I-94 is already expired?

Hi Charles. My mum is a green card holder and it will expire this year. She's due for her citizenship now but she can not speak English and they don't have interpreters in her language. She's 49 years old. So She will have to go thru all the process of getting the citizenship. What do you suggest we do?

My husband is a naturalized citizen, he does not have a passport.  We were planning on getting one, but now we are concerned about applying for one and sending in his paperwork, which would leave him with nothing on hand. Can we use a legal copy rather than the original?  He does not look or sound like what most consider a stereotypical immigrant, but just the same.

There are a lot of states whose licenses are not the correct type to fly with and will not be allowed to travel using just their license starting in 2018. If you don't have a passport get one! It's a very important document to have even if you don't plan on ever leaving the us!

Hi, Chuck
Long story short, my husband was a permanent resident in the US til he got into trouble 2005 and the immigration office revoked his green card and now he's on the deport list. But than his dad became US citizen in 1987 and his mom became US citizen in 1992. I don't when but there was a law stating that if one of your parents became a US citizen before you turned 18 your an automatically a citizen. Also his older brother went to do the citizenship 2 years ago and immigration people said to him that he didn't need to do the citizenship test cause his parents were US citizens before he turned 18 years. So, how is that my husband got deny to become a US citizen?

Mr. Kuck, what would you recommend for the following situation:  have TPS, married to a US citizen for 11 years and have a child together.  Was not granted the petition requested because entered the US twice illegally.  Options until now have been to stick with TPS and not leave the country or go back and wait up to 10 years possibly for the "punishment".  It would be difficult for the family to keep their head above water without that person and not to mention the strain on the relationship.

Claudia, if you entered the US twice without inspection, then you are permanently barred from getting a green card through your spouse, and can only ask for forgiveness AFTER you have lived in your home country for 10 years.  There is no way around that bar.  Perhaps Congress will fix this law that prohibits millions of people from legally immigrating.

Hello Kuck,
once again thanks for your invaluable service to the immigrant community.
I've been a permanent resident for 10 years now, I recently applied for citizenship; however, due to the heavy backlog triggered by the election there's a substantial processing delay. I have had my fingerprints taken though and just waiting to be tested. The thing is my permanent resident card expires in 2 months and I've been offered a job overseas. What should I do in that situation?

Generally speaking, if you applies for citizenship more than 6 months prior to your green card expiration, go to USCIS in an infopass and they will extend your green card another 6-12 months to enable you to continue traveling.  You should be naturalized within that time frame.

Hi Mr. Luck, thank you for the valuable information.   My spouse and I went for our immigration interview on November 16th, 2016.   We did well in the interview but forget to bring my spouse's 1st divorce decree (we thought the most current decree was sufficient)  Anyways the sent us formal request for more evidence (decree) which we sent back on 11/23.  My worry is that they have not responded and my uscis website still shows the invite for the interview.  With the current state of affairs, should we be worried.  I was given a work authorization card and advance parole.   I have traveled abroad twice on the parole and got back (before 1/20) without a problem.  Kindly advise.

Hello Chuck, thanks for this valuable information. I have been in the US since 2001. I have 5 kids who are all US citizens. I'm currently on an order of supervision with ICE for the past 10 years. I had a criminal case back in 2003 when on TPS and ICE said it made me deportable.I don't have a felony. Long story short I was kept in custody for over 10 months. Despite me trying to appeal said criminal case ICE tried to deport me. In their quest to get me a travel document from Liberia,my country of birth they failed bcus the Liberian consulate told them I'm not a Liberian citizen bcus my father was a foreigner and not Liberian and the Liberian constitution states your are not a citizen if your father is a foreigner. ICE even set up a conference call with the Lebanon consulate (my deceased father was from lebanon) back in 2006 but of course I wasn't born there so they couldn't issue me a travel document. ICE released me and I have been on an order of supervision for over ten years where I report to ICE once or twice a year. My next check in is in March 2017 and I'm afraid cus i don't know what will happen. I have two sisters who are US citizens and all my kids are here. Both my parents are deceased. America has been my home the past 17 years. Please advise!

Thank you Chuck for your valuable advice. I have lived in the US since 1999, but for the last 5 years I have been working for an International Organization in Africa. I usually visit my 3 children, two or three times a year, using a visitors B1/B2 visa, currently valid till 2021. In 2004, I was arrested for Domestic violence in NJ against my wife  (she's now an ex-wife). The judge granted me a carry over sentence of 6 months. My lawyer who had urged me to plead guilty  explained that this was not jail term and that after 6 months, the record would be expunged. However, when I was renewing my visa, it was written NCIII hit does not affect visa. So Everytime I came to the US, I would be stopped briefly for questioning. This stopped in 2015 when I got a 5 year visa (maybe due to elapsing of 10 years since the conviction). My two questions; 1. Will this prevent me from being admitted to the US now? 2. If I am denied entry, can I be let to fly to Canada from Newark so my children  (they are US citizens) can come to meet me there?

Hi Mr. Kuck,
I sent that question last week maybe u missed it. Hoping u can help me out pls. 
My sister have been leaving in the USA since 2009. She was granted TPS since she was here before the massive 2012 earthquake in Haiti. She's here with both of her children, they're in high school. Her TPS expires in July and she's concerned bcz by now she would've heard something as to how/when to get it renewed. Do u know if they're renewing TPS? If not, what should she do?

just paying taxes does not get you a green card.  :-(  If hhat were the case, we would have very few undocumented immigrants.

Hi Mr Kuck 
Thank you for posting this. I'm a little worried. I have two arrests here, one justified and one not. First one is a dui over 5 years old and now expunged. The other is a drunk in public place which was dismissed due to no grounds for arrest. I have already spoken to a lawyer and he said it may be best to wait 2 years to apply for citizenship. Does this sound like good advice? I'm worried with the current situation. I don't drink anymore and my life is perfect now with a wonderful woman I am marrying in October.

You must show good moral character for 5 years prior to filing for natz.  looks like yo only have one conviction, 5 years ago, so you are good to file.

Does the other one not matter? As it was dismissed? I consulted a lawyer for a free half hour and he said they may take it into account.

So free legal advice told you to wait?  Without a detailed look at your case by an experienced immigration lawyer it is nigh on impossible to advise you.  Generally speaking an arrest is NOT grounds to deny naturalization if there was no conviction.

I have spent almost half my life and definitely more than half of my adult life in America. I'm a citizen.  Of America is good enough to live in then it's good enough to be a citizen of.

Good day Mr. Kick. Thank you for this very informative blog. I am a naturalized US citizen. I have adopted a toddler from my home Island of Grenada, how can I bring my adopted child to the U.S with me on my next visit to Grenada. Things are very difficult under this new administration. Thanks

You have to be very careful here. A person who travels ina visitor visa with the intent to get a green card immediately after entry would be inadmissible to the US.
