15 Most Epic Live GRAMMY Collaborations
Kevin Mazur/WireImage
The 
GRAMMYs
 are good for two things: 
Really amazing red carpet looks
 and bringing together artists who might otherwise never work together. Oh, and 
people get awards
, too. 
The 2016 GRAMMYs air on Monday, Feb. 15, and play host to some of the year's biggest musical collaborations. Tori Kelly will sing with James Bay, Pitbull will bring out Robin Thicke and Travis Barker, and a cast of Meghan Trainor, John Legend, Demi Lovato and Luke Bryan will team for a tribute to Lionel Richie. And that's just for starters! 
As we prep for the big show, take a look back at some of the most epic GRAMMY collaborations from recent years. And don't miss any of 
our GRAMMY coverage
 on Monday night!

Elton John and Eminem, "Stan," 2001
Elton John and Eminem, "Stan," 2001
Eminem
's third album, 
The Marshall Mathers LP
, was a huge success in 2000, but many claimed Em's lyrics were homophobic. The rapper attempted to make peace with his critics at the 2001 GRAMMYs when he teamed up with 
Elton John
, one of the industry's most prolific gay icons, for a thought-provoking performance of "Stan."

Christina Aguilera, Lil Kim, Mya, Pink & Patti LaBelle, "Lady Maramalade," 2002
Our Diva Meter was already dangerously close to its breaking point when 
Christina Aguilera
, 
Lil Kim
, Mya and 
Pink
 stepped out on the 2002 GRAMMYs stage for a performance of their hit remake, "Lady Marmalade." But when original songstress Patti LaBelle came out at the end, the glass shattered!

Melissa Etheridge & Joss Stone, Janis Joplin Tribute, 2005
Melissa Etheridge & Joss Stone, Janis Joplin Tribute, 2005
While some would argue no one can come close to a proper 
Janis Joplin
 cover, Melissa Etheridge and 
Joss Stone
 gave it a damn good try at the 2005 GRAMMYs. The soulful ladies covered "Cry Baby" and "Piece of My Heart."

Usher & James Brown, "Caught Up/Sex Machine," 2005
Usher & James Brown, "Caught Up/Sex Machine," 2005
James Brown
, the Godfather of Soul, anointed 
Usher
 the "Godson of Soul" during their "Caught Up/Sex Machine" mash-up at the 2005 GRAMMYs. When Brown passed away a year later, Usher told 
People
, "It couldn't have been more of a pleasure to be recognized by James Brown. James Brown introduced me to soul."

Linkin Park, Jay Z & Paul McCartney, "Numb/Encore/Yesterday," 2006
Linkin Park, Jay Z & Paul McCartney, "Numb/Encore/Yesterday," 2006
It was at the 2006 GRAMMYs where we learned that 
Linkin Park
's "Numb," 
Jay Z
's "Encore" and 
the Beatles
' "Yesterday" all kind of sound like the same song. Who knew?

Madonna & Gorillaz, "Feel Good Inc./Hung Up," 2006
Madonna & Gorillaz, "Feel Good Inc./Hung Up," 2006
Six years before 
Tupac
 was 
resurrected at Coachella via hologram
, 
Madonna
 was teaching the world how it was done at the 2006 GRAMMYs. Madge appeared alongside animated hip hop group 
Gorillaz
 as a hologram during "Feel Good Inc." before stepping on stage IRL for a performance of "Hung Up."

Kanye West and Daft Punk, "Stronger," 2008 
Leave it to 
Kanye West
 to get 
Daft Punk
 to agree to their first televised live performance 
ever
. The electronic duo joined Yeezy onstage at the 2008 GRAMMYs for a performance of "Stronger" which samples Daft Punk's crazy-popular 2001 single "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger." Check out a partial clip of it above.

Justin Timberlake, Al Green, Boyz II Men and Keith Urban, "Let's Stay Together," 2009
Everyone came out to go to church with the Reverend 
Al Green
 at the 2009 GRAMMYs: 
Boyz II Men
 sang backup, 
Keith Urban
 was on guitar and 
Justin Timberlake
 took lead vocals alongside the man himself. "Let's Stay Together" never gets old.

Elton John and Lady Gaga, "Poker Face/ Speechless/ Your Song," 2010
Elton John and Lady Gaga, "Poker Face/ Speechless/ Your Song," 2010
Riding high on the success of her 2009 album 
The Fame Monster
, 
Lady Gaga
 teamed up with Elton John to open the 2010 GRAMMY Awards. Gaga handled the "Poker Face" part while Elton came out (in fabulously BeDazzled spectacles) for the "Speechless/Your Song" medley.

Christina Aguilera, Jennifer Hudson, Florence Welch, Martina McBride & Yolanda Adams, "Aretha Franklin Tribute," 2011
Christina Aguilera, Jennifer Hudson, Florence Welch, Martina McBride & Yolanda Adams, "Aretha Franklin Tribute," 2011
Did somebody say diva? To honor music's queen of soul—
Aretha Franklin
, duh—
Christina Aguilera
, 
Jennifer Hudson
, 
Florence Welch
, Martina McBride and Yolanda Adams came together to perform a medley of the "Respect" singer's greatest hits. Each lady got her chance to shine by singing an Aretha song of her choice while the quintet collectively belted through "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman" and "Sisters Are Doing It for Themselves."

Bruno Mars, Rihanna, Sting, Damian Marley & Ziggy Marley, 2013
Bruno Mars, Rihanna, Sting, Damian Marley & Ziggy Marley, 2013
Touted as a tribute to 
Bob Marley
, this performance was really just an amazing medley that closed with a song originally performed by the reggae icon. The nearly seven-minute performance included 
Bruno Mars
 performing his No. 1 hit "Locked Out of Heaven" and Sting doing 
the Police
's "Walking on the Moon." Then they were joined by 
Rihanna
, 
Ziggy Marley
 and 
Damian Marley
 to duet on "Could You Be Loved," by Bob Marley & The Wailers.

Kendrick Lamar & Imagine Dragons, "m.A.A.d city/Radioactive," 2014
Kendrick Lamar & Imagine Dragons, "m.A.A.d city/Radioactive," 2014
While rather unlikely duet partners, 
Imagine Dragons
 and 
Kendrick Lamar
 teamed for one of the most memorable performances at the 2014 GRAMMYs. One of the coolest visuals of the night came when clouds of chalk exploded onstage, covering the artists' all-white ensembles.
In fact, some people thought the performance was 
so 
epic that 
an Internet troll hacked Wikipedia
 and declared 
Kacey Musgraves
' career "over" when she had to follow the intense performance.

Macklemore, Ryan Lewis, Mary Lambert, Trombone Shorty & Madonna, "Same Love/Open Your Heart," 2014
Macklemore, Ryan Lewis, Mary Lambert, Trombone Shorty & Madonna, "Same Love/Open Your Heart," 2014
To perform their acceptance anthem "Same Love," 
Macklemore
, 
Ryan Lewis
 and 
Mary Lambert
 not only created an unforgettable stage collaboration, but a beautiful message of love. In the middle of the performance, 
Queen Latifah
 officiated a wedding ceremony between 33 couples, both gay and straight. Not only that, but then the Queen of Pop 
Madonna
 came out to perform her 1986 classic "Open Your Heart" to celebrate all the love in the room. (Talk about a good wedding band.) Plus, New Orleans jazz legend Trombone Shorty was on hand for a little extra oomph.

Kanye West, Rihanna and Paul McCartney, "FourFiveSeconds," 2015
Weeks after unveiling their surprise collaboration, the trio of 
Yeezy
, 
Rih
 and 
Macca
 took the GRAMMYs stage and performed "FourFiveSeconds" for the first (and so far, only) time together. The song did not appear on either of Rihanna or West's next albums, but has a special place in GRAMMYs folklore, at least.
