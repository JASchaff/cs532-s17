White House is confident it will 'prevail' on travel ban
The White House is confident that it will prevail in a legal back-and-forth over President Donald Trump's executive order to prevent travelers from seven countries entering the United States, spokesman Sean Spicer said on Monday.
"
Clearly the law is on the president's side," Spicer told reporters on Air Force One.
 "He has broad discretion to do what's in the nation's best interest to protect our people, and we feel very confident that we will prevail in this matter.

ON THE CASE: A battle over court's authority
Here's Reuters Commentary columnist Alison Frankel 
on Trump's appeal of immigration ruling
. See an excerpt here:
The U.
S.
 judiciary is the only branch of our government that frequently restricts its own power.
 The constitutional system of checks and balances requires the courts to decide when Congress or the president is overreaching.
 But no one tells the justices of the U.
S.
 Supreme Court, who are appointed for life, that they’re exceeding their constitutional power (except other justices).
 The system depends on judges acting judiciously.
The Trump administration believes the system failed on Friday, when U.
S.
 District Judge 
James Robart
 of Seattle granted a motion by the states of Washington and Minnesota to 
suspend enforcement
 of the president’s week-old travel, immigration and refugee policy.
 The Justice Department’s appeal at the 9th U.
S.
 Circuit Court of Appeals to 
stay Judge Robart’s order
 is, fundamentally, a call on federal courts to limit their own authority to review the president’s power to decide who comes into and goes out of this country.

Key stories from
 President Trump's administration today:
IMMIGRATION ORDER
Trump's temporary immigration ban faces a legal hurdle that could determine whether he can push through the most controversial and far-reaching policy of his first two weeks in office. 
Nearly 100 companies, including some of high-tech's biggest names, join a legal brief opposing the ban, arguing it would give companies incentives to move jobs outside the United States. 
Trump faces an uphill battle to overcome a federal judge's temporary hold on the ban, but the outcome of a ruling on the executive order's ultimate legality is less certain. 
Refugees in the United States, fearing a worsening climate of xenophobia in the wake of a divisive U.
S.
 presidential campaign, are flocking to Canada.
RUSSIA
The Kremlin says it did not agree with Trump's assessment of Iran as "the number one terrorist state," and a Russian diplomat says any U.
S.
 attempt to reopen the Iran nuclear deal would inflame tensions in the Middle East.
 
The Kremlin says it wants an apology from Fox News over what it says were "unacceptable" comments that network host Bill O'Reilly made about Russian President Vladimir Putin in an interview with Trump. 
The European Union will keep sanctions on Russia until Moscow drops its support for the separatist rebellion in Ukraine, foreign ministers say, as Trump promises better ties with the Kremlin. 
OTHER INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
Iran says a recent missile trial launch was not intended to send a message to Trump and to test him and Iranian officials say that after a series of his policy statements, they already "know him quite well." 
The speaker of Britain's lower house of Parliament says he will not support any plans for Trump to address the body during a state visit planned for later this year, citing the president's temporary immigration ban.
Chancellor Angela Merkel says she opposes unilateral steps to impose tariffs on imports, adding that should the new U.
S.
 administration back such protectionist measures, Germany will have to decide how to respond.

Monday Morning Briefing: The limits of the president's pen
The Trump administration found out it will take more than the stroke of a pen to enact immigration policy.
Friday night:
Judge James Robart, a George W. Bush appointee to the federal district court in Seattle, put a temporary kibosh on 
President Donald Trump's ban
 on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries.
 The ruling allowed travelers with valid visas to enter the United States.
 But it didn't do much to ease the confusion, since they didn't know if the judge's restraining order would stand up to the Trump administration's imminent appeal.
Saturday:
Trump 
lashed out
 at the "
so-called-judge
," and vowed that the Seattle decision would be overturned on appeal.
Sunday:
Shortly after midnight, the government filed its appeal to the Seattle decision, arguing that Robart's ruling poses an immediate harm to the public, thwarts enforcement of an executive order and "second-guesses the president’s national security judgment.
 At 4 a.
m.
 ET, 
the appellate court rejected
 the ban on the ban on the ban. 
Put another way, Robart's ruling will stand at least until the federal appeals court rules on the government's application for an emergency stay.
 The court was awaiting further submissions from the states of Washington and Minnesota, and from the federal government on Monday.
 Trump returned to 
Twitter
 to 
express
 his displeasure.
Today:
 
Apple, Google and Microsoft
 led a group of technology companies to file a legal brief opposing Trump's temporary immigration ban, arguing that it "inflicts significant harm on American business."

President Donald Trump's temporary immigration ban faces crucial legal hurdles this week that could determine whether he is able to push through the most far-reaching and controversial policy of his first two weeks in office.
On Monday, the government has a deadline to justify the executive order temporarily barring immigrants from seven mostly Muslim countries and the entry of refugees after a federal judge in Seattle blocked it with a temporary restraining order on Friday.
