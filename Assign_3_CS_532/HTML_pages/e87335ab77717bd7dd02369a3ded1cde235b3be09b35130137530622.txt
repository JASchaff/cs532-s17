Lady Gaga’s name has been on her Little Monsters' lips for a long time. Now, the world famous songstress wants everyone's lips to be sipping a glass of her signature wine.


As first reported by 
TMZ,
 the “Million Reasons” singer recently submitted paperwork to “produce wine, wine coolers, wine cocktails and wine punches” under the brand name Grigio Girls--which also happens to be the name of a track off the 
deluxe edition
 of her 2016 album “Joanne.”

In a 2016 interview with 
Radio.com,
 Gaga revealed that the tune “Grigio Girls” was inspired by a friend battling stage-four cancer.


 “It’s about how me and all of our girlfriends would get together and cry without her when she’s not around, because we love her so much.”


And, as suggested by the song’s chorus, these crying sessions would likely involve lots of wine:


All the Pinot, Pinot Grigio girls 
 Pour your heart out
 Watch your blues turn gold
 All the Pinot, Pinot Grigio girls
 Keep it real cold 
 'Cause it's a fired-up world


Gaga (real name Stefani Germanotta) has yet to publicly announce her entry into the world of wine-making, but once she does, she’ll become the latest in a long line of celebrity oenophiles. 


Hollywood elite like “Godfather” director Francis Ford Coppola, “Santa Clarita Diet” actress Drew Barrymore, and Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie (just to name a few) have all previously released their own wines under various labels. In 2013, Wine Spectator even rated the now separated Brangelina's rosé, the 
Jolie-Pitt & Perrin Côtes de Provence Rosé Miraval,
 as the best in the world.

According to 
The Sun,
 Gaga began looking to enter the wine industry after going on a 2012 retreat to Sonoma Valley with then-boyfriend Taylor Kinney, and she’s been keen on growing her own grapes ever since.


“She also sees a vineyard as a business investment and something she can work on with Taylor when her pop career comes to an end,” an unnamed source said at the time.
