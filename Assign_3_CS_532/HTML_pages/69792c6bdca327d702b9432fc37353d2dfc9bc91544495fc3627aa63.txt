Learning a lesson in political modesty from Lady Gaga

On Tomi’s “Final Thoughts,” she dishes on controversial pop star Lady Gaga, pointing out that she set an example other entertainers should follow during her Super Bowl halftime show. Tomi appreciates that Lady Gaga chose to keep her political opinions to herself throughout the performance, something Meryl Streep and other celebrities can learn from. Tomi contrasts this approach with many of the Super Bowl commercials, which “capitalized on political ignorance with a side of hypocrisy.”
