    Twitter users are writing postcards with the hashtags #PostcardstoBannon and #PresidentBannon to express their concerns over President Trump.
    
USA TODAY
An embarrassment. Anti-American. Chaotic.
That's how critics have described former Breitbart News chiefÂ Stephen Bannon's performance as an adviser to President Trump over the past two weeks. And there's one other epithet: "President Bannon."
Using the #PostcardstoBannon and #PresidentBannon hashtags, people took to Twitter to show off postcards they plan to send to the White House. Some used templates from the Women's March movement, which encourages people to send postcards to government officials expressing their concerns. Others used postcards from museums or holiday cards.
Regardless, these correspondents did not hold back.

The hasthagÂ 
#PresidentBannon surfaced last week
 after Trump signed an executive order appointing Bannon to the National Security Council. It also came amid confusion over the executive order instituting a temporary travel ban to and from seven Muslim-majority countries and suspending the refugee program.
