We need volunteers.


There's something here for every kind of volunteer. Some folks join us daily, some weekly, some a couple times a year. No matter what your schedule or interests, we will put you to work.

We run on your generosity.


A gift of support to 826 will help us inspire young writers, develop academic skills, and enhance the confidence of thousands of students. We promise to put every dollar to good use.
