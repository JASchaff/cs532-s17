New Education Secretary Betsy DeVos loves 'school choice' â here's what that means

  Both President Donald Trump and his newly confirmed secretary of
  education, Betsy DeVos, are vocal advocates of giving families
  alternatives to public school, which Trump 

  has called
 "a government-run monopoly."




  DeVos, in particular, has championed vouchers â publicly funded
  credits parents can use to send their kids to the school of their
  choosing.




  Many of those schools are charter schools, private schools, or
  magnet schools.




  Here's what differentiates them.




  Private schools




  Private schools may be the most popular of the three, not to
  mention the most straightforward.




  Instead of receiving taxpayer dollars to teach a standard,
  federally mandated curriculum, private schools charge tuition to
  teach outside those constraints.

  Depending on the state, private schools may still need to teach
  certain subjects 

  to keep consistent
 with public schools.




  The vouchers DeVos supports most often apply to private schools â
  a move viewed 
by many
  public-school teachers
 as harmful to the system because it
  siphons taxpayer money away from public schools.




  Students may also get scholarships or grants to attend private
  schools, similar to how the university system functions.




  Charter schools




  At their most basic level, charter schools are schools that are
  privately run but publicly funded. They are free to deviate from
  most state guidelines â excluding tests â and can range in size
  from one student at home to thousands across the country.




  Popular charter schools include New York's Success Academy
  network, which has 41 branches, and the BASIS network in Arizona,
  Texas, and Washington, DC, which comprises 21 charter schools.




  According to 

  recent estimates
, about 3 million students in the US attend
  charter schools.




  As their name implies, charter schools must adhere to their
  specific charter. Some charters focus on engineering and math;
  others focus on the arts. They have school boards and management
  organizations that regulate their operations and employ teachers,
  similar to public school boards and districts.

  Magnet schools




  Magnets â so named for their ability to draw students across
  district lines â are specialized public schools. They're similar
  to charters in offering nontraditional courses, but they are
  wholly public in both their funding and operation.




  They emerged in the 1970s as a remedy to racial segregation in
  public schools. Many of them were in poorer areas with larger
  minority populations, the idea being to pull white students into
  these areas.




  Popular magnets include the School for the Talented and Gifted in
  Dallas and the Academic Magnet High School in North Charleston,
  South Carolina.




  There are about 
2,700
  magnets
 across the US compared with 
5,300
  charters
 and 

  33,600
 private schools.
