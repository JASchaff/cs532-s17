Teachers union on DeVos confirmation: 'A sad day for children'













The president of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) is blasting Tuesday's Senate vote to confirm Betsy DeVos as secretary of Education, saying it is a ‚Äúsad day for children."



‚ÄúIf she wants to work with the educators who work hard every single day‚Äîin districts as diverse as McDowell County, W.Va., Detroit, and Scarsdale, N.Y.‚Äîto provide children the opportunities they deserve, we renew our invitation to have her visit America‚Äôs public schools and see the strategies that work for kids,‚Äù Randi Weingarten said in a statement after the vote.






‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs more likely we‚Äôll now hear the same trashing of public schools that the disrupters, the privatizers and the austerity hawks have used for the last two decades. That makes this a sad day for children.‚Äù





The Senate earlier¬†
confirmed DeVos
¬†to helm the Education Department with a tie-breaking vote from Vice President Pence, a first for a Cabinet nominee.



Weingarten, along with other major teachers unions, has been a vocal opponent of DeVos‚Äôs nomination, arguing that she lacks public school experience. She said Tuesday that one bright spot of DeVos‚Äôs confirmation is that the public has become more vocal about education and will serve as ‚Äúa check and balance."

Charter Schools - Dividing Communities since 1991
























CHARTER SCHOOL SCANDALS Website




CHARTER SCHOOL SCANDALS
A compilation of news articles about charter schools which have been charged with, or are highly suspected of, tampering with admissions, grades, attendance and testing; misuse of funds and embezzlement; engaging in nepotism and conflicts of interest; engaging in complicated and shady real estate deals; and/or have been engaging in other questionable, unethical, borderline-legal, or illegal activities. This is also a record of charter school instability and other unsavory tidbits.
