Rosie O’Donnell says she’s available to play White House adviser Steve Bannon on “Saturday Night Live,” creating a sensation of anticipation.


The comic actress took the bait from Twitter (several people get credit for the idea), and ran with it.


President Trump’s longtime criticism of O’Donnell made the concept irresistible to fans of SNL.

“Just the IDEA of @Rosie playing Bannon on SNL is worthy of an Emmy,” said one commenter, referencing an award being pushed for Melissa McCarthy in the wake of her impression of press secretary Sean Spicer.


That skit reportedly bothered Trump a lot, so Rosie aims to rub salt in the wound.


“When news circulated late Monday night that Trump’s biggest issue with S.N.L.’s Spicer sketch was McCarthy’s gender, someone floated the idea that perhaps his old nemesis, Rosie O’Donnell, should play Trump’s top adviser: Steve Bannon. And as that idea picked up steam on Twitter, it made its way to O’Donnell herself, who was immediately game,” 
said Vanity Fair
.


Whose idea was it?


O’Donnell replied to the suggestion via Calvin Phillips, who gave a hat tip to San Diego publicist 
Stephanie Thompson
. But freelance writer Staley Sharples of Chicago also took credit for the casting.
