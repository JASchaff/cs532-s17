The air today is thick with 
liberal
 
tears
 over Betsy DeVos’ confirmation as education secretary. But some tears are saltier than others.

In the wee hours of the morning, Vanity Fair film critic Richard Lawson, for example. Before DeVos had even been confirmed, he was bracing for the worst. Like, the 
very
 worst:

Maybe he got tired of being accurately labeled a drama queen.

Yes, it really is.

 Do these liberal leftist scare tactics really work on commonsense free thinking people? NOPE. The sky isn't falling.

Guess not. But hey, maybe we’re being too hard on the guy. Maybe he’s smarter and he just understands the intricacies of school choice better than we do.

Nah:

Strong public schools are the bedrock of a thriving, autonomous middle class. No wonder zealot billionaires want to get rid of them!

DeVos thinks it doesn't get better for queer and disabled children, she thinks it gets different. They're muffled into silence or they die

And one more deleted tweet:



By all means, take this guy seriously.
