Lady Gaga Crushes Digital Sales Post Super Bowl Halftime Performance


Following her acrobatic display during the Super Bowl , Lady Gaga’s digital sales increased over 1,000% according to a report by Nielsen Music. 
Nielsen
 also reported that approx. 111.3 million viewers watched the Super Bowl While there were tweets and memes about Lady Gaga wearing an atomic adult diaper (harness), she will be wearing that diaper all the way to the bank. This helps prove the important marriage between traditional and digital media to increase sales. Something we show (cough, #humblebrag) how to do in our book on 
Digital Leadership
. (Source:

YouTube’s New Double-Tap Feature Will Change Your Life 


Finally! No more sitting through boring parts of a video, or restarting videos to watch a segment again. Thanks to a new update on YouTube’s mobile app, you can now fast-forward or rewind 10 seconds into a video by double-tapping the right or left edge of your screen. So when you’re trying to skip through the slow intro, or rewind to watch that amazing catch again, you can now do so with ease. (Source:

IKEA’s Kitchen Table of the Future


By 2025, IKEA hopes to have a new kind of kitchen table/stove available to shoppers. The smart kitchen table will use light projection from a camera above the table, bringing food objects to life to help you recognize what ingredients you have set out, and provide suggestions for what to make with those ingredients — think a combination of a cutting board and a giant iPad that displays on the cutting board in digital text instructions on what part of the asparagus to cut and discard. It is also equipped with built-in scales and burners to help you cook food on the spot. When this product comes out, does this mean everyone will be cooking like Rachael Ray? (Source:
