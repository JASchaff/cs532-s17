	It’d be a real drag for the commander-in-chief.
 

	Longtime President Trump nemesis Rosie O’Donnell vowed she was “here to serve” as a “Saturday Night Live” caricature of White House chief strategist Steve Bannon following a report of Trump’s displeasure at his press secretary, Sean Spicer, 
being parodied by a woman
 on late-night TV.
 

	“i am here to serve - alec has trump - melissa has spice - i would need a few days to prepare - so if called - i will be ready,” O’Donnell tweeted Monday night, pointing to Alec Baldwin’s Trump and Melissa McCarthy’s Spicer and later adding the hashtag #BannoninChief.

	“available - if called i will serve !!!,” she wrote subsequently. “HONORED - they know where 2 find me.”
 
 
Rosie O’Donnell urges America to ‘stop' Donald Trump 
 
 

	Replying to one Twitter user who provided an uncanny side-by-side of her and the Breitbart CEO-turned-presidential adviser, O’Donnell wrote, “i can see it.”

A look at Saturday Night Live's most memorable characters 
 
 
 
 
 

	“SNL” has thus far portrayed Bannon as a masked grim reaper, played by new cast member Mikey Day, who pulls Trump’s strings and goads him into instigating international incidents.
 

	McCarthy, in her spot-on Spicer spoof during a surprise visit to the sketch show Saturday night, had worn an unshapely suit, screamed at journalists, fudged facts in an echo of Spicer’s disastrous first briefing room appearance, and mocked his penchant for chewing and swallowing large quantities of gum.

	But according to a 
Politico
 report Monday, it was Spicer’s portrayal by a female comedian that most unsettled Trump — who remained uncharacteristically silent on Twitter Sunday morning.

	Several Twitter users, in turn, urged NBC to hire O’Donnell — a vocal Trump critic whose feud with the POTUS stretches back to 2006 — to needle him even further.

	“What if Rosie O’Donnell saves democracy,” mused Vanity Fair film critic Richard Lawson.
