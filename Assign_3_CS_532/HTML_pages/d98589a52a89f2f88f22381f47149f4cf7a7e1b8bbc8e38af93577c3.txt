I haven't read this, but my people tell me it's a great executive order. The best.






Only two weeks in and this administration is proving to be utterly incompetent. How bad is it? They can’t even figure out 
how to turn on the lights:




Aides confer in the dark because they cannot figure out how to operate the light switches in the cabinet room. Visitors conclude their meetings and then wander around, testing doorknobs until finding one that leads to an exit. In a darkened, mostly empty West Wing, Mr. Trump’s provocative chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, finishes another 16-hour day planning new lines of attack.




That incompetence is laughable, the example below is dangerous. Anonymous sources told the 
New York Times
 Reince Preisbus is wrestling for control of the White House because of the bumbling of everyone involved, especially the commander in chief:




Mr. Priebus bristles at the perception that he occupies a diminished perch in the West Wing pecking order compared with previous chiefs. But for the moment, Mr. Bannon remains the president’s dominant adviser, despite 
Mr. Trump’s anger that he was not fully briefed on details of the executive order he signed giving his chief strategist a seat on the National Security Council, a greater source of frustration to the president than the fallout from the travel ban.




Emphasis added. Donald Trump signed an executive order removing the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the National Intelligence Director from the principals committee of the National Security Staff and added Steve Bannon, the former editor of Brietbart, in an executive order 
he never even read. 
He apparently did not know the details until the media began to cover it. Friends, that is dereliction of duty. 














The 
NYT 
also noted how cozy House Speaker Paul Ryan and Steve Bannon have become:




Mr. Bannon, whose website, Breitbart, was a magnet for white nationalists and xenophobic speech, has also tried to reassure official Washington. He has been careful to build bridges with the Republican establishment, especially Mr. Ryan — whom he once described as “the enemy” and vowed to force out. He now talks regularly with Mr. Ryan to coordinate strategy or plot their planned overhaul of the tax code.




And now we have confirmation that House Speaker Paul Ryan is capable of putting up with misogyny, racism, bigotry, xenophobia, the whole kit and kaboodle. As long as the end game is tax cuts for the wealthy, what’s a little racism and xenophobia between friends?

Richard Nixon’s former White House Counsel weighs in:

Only a very weak POTUS allows an aide to secretly self promote and go where no political aide has ever been: Bannon's permanent NSC seat.
