The theory that Bannon deliberately provoked the chaos certainly squares with his Leninist theory of sowing chaos in govt to destroy it so that you can build something entirely new.
You can't say that is true; it is only a theory.  It was him and the speechwriter making this decision and they could simply have wanted to look tougher.
But they rolled out the "Bannon replaces JCS and DNI on NCS principals cmte" news with zero fanfare on a Friday newsdump day too.
The administration's Himmler is consolidating power and making it clear to supporters that he is a real life ITG.

So much this. This chaos is intentional on their part. None of these consequences are unintended. I am also sure that any locals in hotspots around the world who were thinking about helping the US are seriously reconsidering that decision. I am also sure that is intentional.
The current regime is agitating for an 'event' that will allow them to tighten this country down so tight it will squeak. Buckle up folks, it's gonna get much worse.

That may be the point.  The Administration may tell the courts to go hang, and I think they will get away with it.  This is exactly the sort of issue that will get his supporters fired up.

This contempt charge lead to his impeachment.
If Trump keeps instructing his stooges to ignore the court order, he and his entire advisory staff should be held in contempt, and impeachment proceedings should begin immediately.
THIS IS NOT FARKING NORMAL!

There are two dangers in dealing with Trump and his cohorts: underestimating them and overestimating them.  Underestimating them is what got them into the White House.  At the same time, we're not dealing with supervillains.  Yes, I'm sure they all have plans.  But they also have no experience with government and they spend as much time knifing each other as they do going after their external enemies.  Sometimes when Trump is acting like a meth-addicted toddler, it's simply because someone pissed him off.  As far as Bannon, I'm sure he thinks of himself as a genius, but I'm not sure how radicalizing the entire country against the GOP is going to help him advance his goals.  The only thing saving him right now is Paul Ryan's cowardice.
These guys tend to get by more on audacity than planning.  Much of the time they're just brushing their opponents back so that they can buy a few seconds to make their next move.  Keep up the pressure and don't overthink things.

He is in contempt, that's the problem.  The executive branch is responsible for enforcing the law.  There isn't a judicial or legislative police force or army.
There isn't much the courts can do except issue strongly worded rulings.

Ryan wants to remove all traces of Obamacare and turn Medicare into a voucher program and introduce tax breaks for the ultra-rich.  Trump will give him that opportunity.  That is why he will keep a low profile and not denounce Trump.

Impeachment proceedings come from the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. The question is, is there a thimbleful of integrity, an ounce of patriotism, a pinch of respect for our Constitution, between those 248 elected representatives? I think if there was we'd have seen evidence of it already.

Republicans sowing discontent with governance in general? Not really new.  I do know from experience, however,  the GOP won't take blame for this.
It's time to starting asking, what's going to replace our government once someone like Bannon destroys all credibility?  It's deliberate.

Nixon was impeached because he ordered espionage on the DNC.
This rises to that level if he defies the Court stay.

Bannon is not an idiot. He has more actual credentials than most of Trump's inner circle. Don't underestimate him.
He's also not Lex Luthor.  He's not playing three-dimensional chess while everyone else is playing checkers.  If he were truly brilliant, we wouldn't see his fingerprints on any of this.  Instead, we've seen a ham-handed power grab that is causing Trump's support to crater and which is rallying people to organize against them on a level we haven't seen since the 60's.  The GOP is running scared and their entire agenda is in chaos because of all of this.  Yes, we've seen authoritarian takeovers before and they were usually done much better than this.  Bannon is extremely dangerous and he needs to go now, but he's not unbeatable.
