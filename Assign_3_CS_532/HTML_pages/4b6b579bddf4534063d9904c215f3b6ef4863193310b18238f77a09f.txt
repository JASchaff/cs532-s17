BREAKING: DeVos Confirmed In Historic VP-Tie Breaking Vote

They managed to peel away two Republican Senators, but they never got the much-needed third.


Democrats desperately tried to convince just 
one more
 Republican Senator to vote against Betsy DeVos to thwart her ascension to Secretary of Education. They held an all-night filibuster, cajoled, begged and harassed, but in the end it didn’t work.




 
















With a vote split 50-50, Vice President Mike Pence was called in to break the tie and Betsy DeVos became Education Secretary DeVos.


The two Republican senators who voted against DeVos, Maine’s Susan Collins and Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, represent rural states where charter schools are not prevalent and students often have to travel many miles to attend an isolated public school.


The rhetoric got so bad at one point that DeVos’ opponents said her policies could literally 
kill children
.




 
















Meaning voucher programs will lead to more suicides. Betsy DeVos's policies will kill children. That is not an exaggeration in any sense.


— Richard Lawson (@rilaws)

“Voucher programs will create systems in which queer kids have literally zero access to support apparatus bc they are in religious schools,” Vanity Fair Film Critic Richard Lawson wrote. “Meaning voucher programs will lead to more suicides. Betsy DeVos’s policies will kill children.”

The Federalist Papers admins do a wonderful job of going through our founding documents (and sometimes others) to find pertinent, timely and always thought-provoking pieces. I have discovered a new admiration for Patrick Henry from their work! Thank you, admins! - Lisa Hoppman
