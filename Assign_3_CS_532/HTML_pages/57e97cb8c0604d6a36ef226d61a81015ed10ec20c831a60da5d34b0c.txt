Sen. Al Franken on DeVos: ‘Most Incompetent Cabinet-Level Nominee I Have Ever Seen’

Senator 
Al Franken
 has been one of the most vocal Democrats in opposing 
Betsy DeVos
 as Education Secretary, and his statement in response to her confirmation was pretty brutal.


After Franken 
confronted DeVos
 on a number of issues during her confirmation hearing, not only did he conclude he could not vote for her, but 
he said last night that she is
 “fundamentally incompetent” to head the Department of Education.


He used that same exact word again in his statement after the 50-50 vote today (with Vice President 
Mike Pence
 casting the tiebreaker):


One of the most important jobs in our government is the Secretary of Education, who directly oversees the policies that children, teachers, school administrators, and entire communities depend on. It’s not a job for amateurs who don’t know the first thing about education. I voted against the nomination of Betsy DeVos, a billionaire Republican donor, because she is the most incompetent cabinet-level nominee I have ever seen. Last night, I urged my Republican colleagues to oppose her nomination, because if we cannot set party loyalty aside long enough to perform the essential duty of vetting the President’s nominees, then I don’t know what we are even doing here. Betsy DeVos has demonstrated that she is fundamentally unqualified to lead the Education Department, and it’s a shame that Republicans voted to confirm one of their major donors instead of looking out for our children
