	This is the most random combo I've heard of since Britney had Marilyn Mansion on her Circus tour.




	But random in a good way I think. Hahaha.




	Interested to see what they'll do.

	I get the feeling this might've been originally planned for the SB and maybe conflicting schedules didn't allow it, so they're doing it at the Grammys? I think it will be a really good combination though. Haven't they both spoken quite well of each-other in the past?

	I don't know, I don't really pay much attention to either act (this forum is my only source of Gaga news - and I don't have any source of Metallica news). But that's cool if so.
