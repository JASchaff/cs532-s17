The current Queen of Pop Lady Gaga is reportedly planning a ‘very special and unique’ duet with rock Gods Metallica at the 2017 Grammy Awards.


The game was given away by a promo for Sunday’s awards show which was tweeted by a Gaga fansite and which revealed that ‘Lady Gaga duets with Metallica’ – the band had previously revealed in January that they were due to perform at the ceremony, promising that they have something very special and unique planned for their appearance.


The duet comes on the back of Gaga’s incredible Super Bowl Half-time performance on February 5, a 13-minute extravaganza that saw three costume changes, subtle political statements thanks songs Born This Way, This Land Is Your Land, and God Bless America – and 
that jump off the top of the football stadium
.




This year’s ceremony will also see performances by Daft Punk who will be on stage with The Weeknd to perform Starboy, Adele, Bruno Mars, Katy Perry and Alicia Keys.


Beyonce, who recently revealed she is pregnant with twins, 
is also expected to perform
.


Metallica are nominated for Best Rock Song for Hardwired from their most recent album Hardwired… to Self-Destruct.
