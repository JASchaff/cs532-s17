Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly on Tuesday dismissed a since-corrected 
Washington Post
 report saying White House strategist Steve Bannon visited him to urge him not to weaken President Donald Trump's immigrant travel ban.


“It was a fantasy story,” Kelly said. Of the reporter, he said: “Assuming he’s not making it up… whoever his sources are, are playing him for a fool.”

The 
Post 
had reported Bannon personally visited Kelly Jan. 28 to ask him not to issue a waiver for lawful permanent residents or green card holders. The report said Kelly “refused to comply” and cited two administration officials “familiar with the confrontation.” 


The 
Post 
corrected the story after White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Bannon did not visit Kelly. The newspaper added a note from editorial page editor Fred Hiatt apologizing for not requesting comment from the White House before publishing the story. 






















White House denies report Bannon met with Kelly to stop green-card waiver







            By

Democratic Congresswoman Kathleen Rice asked Kelly if he was concerned about political operatives attempting to influence the Department of Homeland Security. 


“I work for one man," Kelly said. "His name is Donald Trump, obviously. He has told me, ‘Kelly, secure the border.’ and that’s what I’ll do."
