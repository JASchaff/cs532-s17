Reince Priebus reportedly had to draft a new ten-step checklist for the administration to follow before Trump signs any more executive orders.


In addition to the revelation that Trump's aides don't know how to properly turn the White House lights on and off, the 
New York Times
 
reported
 Monday that the president was not fully briefed on the executive order he signed last week giving his chief strategist Steve Bannon a seat on the National Security Council. 
According to the 
Times
, which confirmed the account after interviewing numerous government officials, aides, and former staff members, Trump grew frustrated when he realised after signing the order that it gave Bannon more power than he initially thought. Trump was apparently more upset about that than he was with the public uproar surrounding his controversial immigration ban.
The White House chief-of-staff, Reince Priebus, has since decided to loop the president in earlier in the drafting process – which usually isn't necessary – and has had to create a ten-step checklist for the administration to follow before Trump signs off on another executive order.
Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News, allegedly told his allies that he and White House policy director, Stephen Miller, had to move quickly to solidify their vision of Trump's "economic nationalism" before losing influence in the administration. 
The 
order
 – reportedly crafted by Bannon and Miller – gave the chief strategist a spot on the National Security Council and lowers the influence of the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The move gives Bannon, who previously had no designated national security role, a say in decisions regarding the nation's diplomacy, counterterrorism efforts, nuclear power and cybersecurity.
Maybe now Trump will start reading his executive orders as closely as he read 
that 17-page curtain catalogue
