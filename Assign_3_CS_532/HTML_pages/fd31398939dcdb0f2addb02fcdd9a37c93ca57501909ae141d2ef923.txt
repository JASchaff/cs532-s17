New education secretary Betsy DeVos champions vouchers and charter schools â here's what that means

  During a January 18 Senate confirmation hearing, Betsy DeVos,
  President Donald Trump's pick for Secretary of Education, took a
  

  battery of questions
 related to her views on gun control,
  disability laws, and performance standards.




  But perhaps no two topicsÂ have surrounded the
  newly-confirmed education secretary more this past election
  season than vouchers and charter schools. DeVos has expressed
  support for both as alternatives to traditional public school.




  Now thatÂ DeVos is confirmed, the concepts will likely stick
  around for much of the new president's term(s). To help demystify
  them, here's what vouchers and charter schools actually do â and
  why some people may oppose or support them.




  Vouchers




  The cost to teach aÂ public school student for one year,
  

  according to 2012 data
, isÂ approximately $10,615. An
  education voucher lets parents apply that money to a private or
  religious school, perhaps if they live in an area with bad public
  schools or want to give their child a specific kind of education.




  Today, roughly 

  400,000 kids
 in 29 states attend schools with help from a
  voucher, according to the advocacy group EdChoice.




  Proponents like DeVos say the system gives at-risk kids a
  betterÂ shot at getting a quality education: With a voucher,
  they can attend a school to which their family otherwise has no
  access. Critics believeÂ the vouchers siphon precious dollars
  away from public schools, since taxpayer dollars are getting
  diverted to fund private education.




  As secretary of education, DeVos has promised to expand existing
  voucher programs in line with President-elect Trump's goal to
  provide more school choice. In the past he 

  has called
 public schools "
a government-run
  monopoly."

  Charter schools




  At their most basic level, charter schools are schools that are
  privately run but publicly funded. They are free to deviate from
  most state guidelines â excluding tests â and can range in size
  from one student learning at home to thousands across the
  country.




  Popular charter schools include New York's Success Academy
  network, which hasÂ 34 branches, and the 24-school BASIS
  network in Arizona, Texas, and Washington D.C.




  Recent 

  estimates
 find there are approximately three million students
  in the US currently attending charter schools.




  Charters are made up of three specific groups: the Charter
  Management Organization (CMO), the authorizer, and the school
  board.




  The CMO is a nonprofit that essentially acts as the the school
  district. It handles the logistics of running the charter school.
  The CMO also employs the teachers at a given charter school, not
  the school itself. If the school closes, teachers may be able to
  find a job within another school overseen by the CMO.




  The authorizer controls the actual mission of the school â
  whether it caters to science and engineering, the arts, or some
  other focus. Typically, the authorizer is a local university or
  the state department of education. It's up to the authorizer to
  ensure the charter school is making good on its actual charter;
  if the school isn't passing muster, the authorizer can pull the
  charter and close the school.




  Finally, the school board functions as a normal board would. It's
  made up of parents and community members and effectively does
  quality assurance on the ground to make sure the authorizer and
  CMO are running smoothly.

  Charter schools are often viewed in one of two ways. Advocates
  like DeVos see them as a leg up for disadvantaged kids and a
  chance for students in the public-school system to expand their
  horizons. If a child loves to tinker and build, a charter focused
  on engineering can encourageÂ those interests.




  Like voucher programs, opponents may recognize those benefits but
  fear they come at too steep a cost
.
 Critics say the
  charter system competes with public schools because they draw
  from the same pot of public funds, hurting the kids attending
  normal public school.




  People who oppose charter schools 

  also allege
Â the large-scale donors, such as the Bill and
  Melinda Gates Foundation and the Walton Family Foundation,
  wantÂ to turn education into a business model. They claim the
  extra fundsÂ may inadvertently breed 

  segregation
 in public schools.




  One 

  UCLA study
, for example, found the majority of charter school
  students are highly segregated compared to local non-charter
  students, with 7 out of 10 black charter school students
  attending schools that have 90% or more minority populations.




  Critics point to these kinds of studies as examples that while
  charters may give preference to individual students,
  theyÂ come at the cost of properly educating many more.Â
