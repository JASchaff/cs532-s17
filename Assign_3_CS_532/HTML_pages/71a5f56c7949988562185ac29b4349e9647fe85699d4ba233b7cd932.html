Trump</strong> last Saturday night, a certain segment of the population waited for the president to explode on Twitter the next morning. &#x201C;Every Sunday morning is a countdown until Trump tweets about <em>SNL</em>,&#x201D; comedian <strong>Kumail Nanjiani</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/kumailn/status/828318246885470208">joked</a>. But Trump has kept mum on that subject so far, restricting his messages to the Super Bowl and <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/trump-blame-james-robart-234666">undermining</a> the U.S. judicial system. In the end, however, it wasn&#x2019;t Baldwin or Stewart who reportedly got under Trump&#x2019;s skin: it was <strong>Melissa McCarthy&#x2019;s</strong> brilliant and enormously popular take on <strong>Sean Spicer</strong>. And now Trump&#x2019;s decade-long foe, <strong>Rosie O&#x2019;Donnell</strong>, is offering to help finish the job.</p><p data-reactid=".1zx4n5iibcw.1.1.1.0.0.3.$1">Press Secretary Spicer is already on record as being casually displeased with McCarthy&#x2019;s bullish, bombastic impression of him. He <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/02/sean-spicer-melissa-mccarthy">told</a> <em>Extra</em> that McCarthy &#x201C;needs to slow down on the gum chewing; way too many pieces in there&#x201D; but generously called the show &#x201C;really funny.&#x201D; But according to <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/melissa-mccarthy-sean-spicer-234715">Politico</a>, it wasn&#x2019;t the gum chewing that displeased Trump. &#x201C;More than being lampooned as a press secretary who makes up facts,&#x201D; a source close to Trump told the Web site, &#x201C;it was Spicer&#x2019;s portrayal by a woman that was most problematic in the president&#x2019;s eyes.&#x201D; Even worse, the potentially emasculating portrayal is allegedly &#x201C;not considered helpful for Spicer&#x2019;s longevity in the grueling, high-profile job in which he has struggled to strike the right balance between representing an administration that considers the media the &#x2018;opposition party,&#x2019; and developing a functional relationship with the press.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1zx4n5iibcw.1.1.1.0.0.3.$2">Throughout his campaign, Trump made it clear that he has certain expectations when it comes to gender. He memorably <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/01/donald-trump-megyn-kelly-feud">kicked off</a> a feud with former Fox News correspondent <strong><a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/people/megyn-kelly#intcid=dt-hot-link">Megyn Kelly</a></strong> when she asked him about his attitude toward women during a primary debate. Kelly&#x2019;s perceived aggression prompted Trump to later claim she had &#x201C;blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever,&#x201D; and to refer to her as a &#x201C;lightweight&#x201D; on Twitter.</p><p data-reactid=".1zx4n5iibcw.1.1.1.0.0.3.$3">But the nastiest, gendered feud of Trump&#x2019;s career (if you don&#x2019;t count the 2016 election) is the public battle he&#x2019;s fought with Rosie O&#x2019;Donnell. Starting in 2006, when O&#x2019;Donnell made disparaging remarks about the future president on <em>The View</em>, Trump told <em>People</em>, &#x201C;Rosie&#x2019;s a loser. A real loser. I look forward to taking lots of money from my nice fat little Rosie.&#x201D; Like his <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/kristen-stewart-saturday-night-live-donald-trump">odd fixation</a> with Kristen Stewart, Trump&#x2019;s public bullying of O&#x2019;Donnell has continued for a surprisingly long period of time&#x2014;a decade and counting&#x2014;and he has taken every possible occasion to take shots at her. The president sometimes bent over backward to include an O&#x2019;Donnell insult in completely unrelated conversations . . .</p><div class="inline-subscribe-ad-container" data-reactid=".1zx4n5iibcw.1.1.1.0.0.3.4"></div><div data-reactid=".1zx4n5iibcw.1.1.1.0.0.3.$4"><div class="embed block row social-twitter"><blockquote class="embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet" lang="en" data-type="twitter" data-url="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/200603697435246592"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/200603697435246592">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/200603697435246592</a></p></blockquote></div></div><p data-reactid=".1zx4n5iibcw.1.1.1.0.0.3.$5">. . . or even <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2016-presidential-debates/donald-trump-resurrects-decade-old-rosie-o-donnell-feud-again-n655306">nationally televised debates</a>. &#x201C;Probably the Trump stuff was the most bullying I ever experienced in my life, including as a child,&#x201D; O&#x2019;Donnell told <em><a href="http://people.com/bodies/rosie-odonnell-on-weight-loss-surgery-the-view-cohost-talks-losing-50-lbs/">People</a></em> in 2016. &#x201C;It was national, and it was sanctioned societally. Whether I deserved it is up to your own interpretation.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1zx4n5iibcw.1.1.1.0.0.3.$6">Given their combative history, it should come as no surprise that O&#x2019;Donnell would want to help <em>S.N.L.</em> pile on to its <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/alec-baldwin-host-saturday-night-live-donald-trump">increasingly confrontational</a> portrayal of the president and his close circle. When news circulated late Monday night that Trump&#x2019;s biggest issue with <em>S.N.L.&#x2019;s</em> Spicer sketch was McCarthy&#x2019;s gender, someone floated the idea that perhaps his old nemesis, Rosie O&#x2019;Donnell, should play Trump&#x2019;s top adviser: <strong>Steve Bannon</strong>. And as that idea picked up steam on Twitter, it made its way to O&#x2019;Donnell herself, who was immediately game.</p><div data-reactid=".1zx4n5iibcw.1.1.1.0.0.3.$7"><div class="embed block row social-twitter"><blockquote class="embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet" lang="en" data-type="twitter" data-url="https://twitter.com/Rosie/status/828792995591888896"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Rosie/status/828792995591888896">https://twitter.com/Rosie/status/828792995591888896</a></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-reactid=".1zx4n5iibcw.1.1.1.0.0.3.$8"><div class="embed block row social-twitter"><blockquote class="embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet" lang="en" data-type="twitter" data-url="https://twitter.com/Rosie/status/828817401718439939"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Rosie/status/828817401718439939">https://twitter.com/Rosie/status/828817401718439939</a></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-reactid=".1zx4n5iibcw.1.1.1.0.0.3.$9"><div class="embed block row social-twitter"><blockquote class="embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet" lang="en" data-type="twitter" data-url="https://twitter.com/Rosie/status/828820454647427073"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Rosie/status/828820454647427073">https://twitter.com/Rosie/status/828820454647427073</a></p></blockquote></div></div><p data-reactid=".1zx4n5iibcw.1.1.1.0.0.3.$10">The person currently portraying Bannon on Saturday nights is new cast member <strong>Mikey Day</strong>, who&#x2014;in full Grim Reaper drag&#x2014;whispers demonically bad ideas into Baldwin&#x2019;s Trump&#x2019;s ear, forcing the president to sit at a miniature desk while he takes the seat of power in the Oval Office. But as TV critic <strong>Alan Sepinwall</strong> <a href="http://uproxx.com/sepinwall/melissa-mccarthy-saturday-night-live-donald-trump-rosie-odonnell/2/">notes</a>, Trump might actually view this depiction of Bannon as a twisted compliment:</p><div data-reactid=".1zx4n5iibcw.1.1.1.0.0.3.$11"><blockquote>
<p>Portraying Bannon as the Grim Reaper doesn&#x2019;t seem to have gotten
Bannon into the same hot water the Politico article suggests Spicer is
now in. Being told that your top adviser is evil is an easy joke, and
maybe even something to be taken as a point of pride, given how much
Trump and Bannon both like to brag about crushing their enemies. But
portray Bannon at his biggest and sloppiest &#x2014; while still forcing the
classy POTUS himself to sit at the little desk &#x2014; and that&#x2019;s something
that might actually make Trump question his trust in the man.</p>
</blockquote></div><p data-reactid=".1zx4n5iibcw.1.1.1.0.0.3.$12">Mikey Day&#x2019;s version of Bannon&#x2014;though demonically evil&#x2014;is powerful. But on the subject of McCarthy as Spicer, a &#x201C;top Trump donor&#x201D; observed to <em>Politico</em>: &#x201C;Trump doesn&#x2019;t like his people to look weak.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1zx4n5iibcw.1.1.1.0.0.3.$13">Trump has time and again betrayed a curious obsession with body image. <em>The Washington Post</em> has a fairly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trumps-weight-problem-he-cant-stop-talking-about-fat-people/2016/09/28/891ddd3a-858d-11e6-a3ef-f35afb41797f_story.html?utm_term=.244722d3a55e">exhaustive rundown</a> of Trump&#x2019;s many targets, which have included <strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong>, <strong>Chris Christie</strong>, <strong>Kim Kardashian West</strong>, former Miss Universe <strong>Alicia Machado</strong>, and, of course, O&#x2019;Donnell. One suspects this evident preoccupation may have also played a role in Trump&#x2019;s allegedly negative reaction to McCarthy, who launched a successful <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/2016/07/117492/melissa-mccarthy-clothing-line-chelsea-interview">plus-sized clothing line</a> in 2015 and often <a href="http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/stylist-judy-b-swartz-melissa-mccarthy-clothing-line-10481597/">wears her own designs</a> on the red carpet.  So holding up O&#x2019;Donnell&#x2014;whom Trump has called a &#x201C;fat pig&#x201D; in the past&#x2014;as a mirror to Bannon <em>does</em> seem like a perfectly crafted blow.</p><p data-reactid=".1zx4n5iibcw.1.1.1.0.0.3.$14">It seems unlikely that <em>S.N.L.</em> will tap O&#x2019;Donnell for the part. The show doesn&#x2019;t often cast its roles by committee. But O&#x2019;Donnell&#x2014;a plus-size, gay woman&#x2014;stepping into the role of the power behind Trump&#x2019;s throne might just be the thing to send the president over the edge. (If that&#x2019;s the goal.) And given the president&#x2019;s recent reaction to <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/media/317599-time-cover-labels-bannon-the-great-manipulator">whispers about</a> the power Bannon holds over him

But this year, the tradition got an edgy added boost of queer indie cinema aesthetic, thanks to host <strong>Kristen Stewart</strong>. Hot on the heels of publicly <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/02/kristen-stewart-says-fuck-saturday-night-live-gay-monologue-trump\">expressing her own sexuality</a> in the most forthright way she has yet, the historically private Stewart backed up her claim with a steamy and unexpectedly French faux commercial.</p>\n<noscript></noscript><p>Stewart’s character, Sabine, sexually liberating Vanessa’s chipper housewife character would be a funny enough premise for a sketch, but the joke lands even better in the context of <em>S.N.L.’s</em> history with fake Totino’s ads. The first fake commercial aired on Super Bowl Eve in 2015, when soon-to-be-Oscar-winner <strong>J.K. Simmons</strong> was hosting. Playing Bayer’s football-loving husband as gruff and chilly, Simmons banishes her to the kitchen with a patronizing “activity kit” to keep her occupied. When <strong>Beck Bennett’s</strong> character asks, “Does your wife want to watch the game with us?” Simmons rudely rejects him.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A8WIBv3erj8?ecver=2\"><iframe height=\"360\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A8WIBv3erj8?ecver=2\"></iframe></div></div></div><p>Here, the most important two elements of the ongoing Totino’s spoof were born: the unflagging positivity of Bayer, and the repeated, stale Super Bowl commercial phrase: “my hungry guys!”</p>\n<p>While the demeaning dismissal of women during sporting events was the theme of the 2015 Totino’s commercial, the 2016 version creepily addressed the empty, lock-step behavior of some sports fans. The commercial starts as usual, with Bayer enjoying a husband upgrade. (This time, Bennett’s gentler character plays her main hungry guy.) Host <strong>Larry David</strong> is also on hand, as well as some <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/08/saturday-night-live-gay-jokes-kate-mckinnon\">ghosts of <em>S.N.L.</em> casts past</a>, like <strong>Jay Pharoah</strong> and <strong>Jon Rudnitsky</strong>. The persistent, chanting cheers from Bayer’s “hungry guys” turn horrifying when she discovers the TV they’re watching isn’t even on.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3dzOLoOEToc?ecver=2\"><iframe height=\"360\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3dzOLoOEToc?ecver=2\"></iframe></div></div></div><p>So after mocking macho Super Bowl behavior for two years, <em>S.N.L.</em> took the edgiest approach of all by rendering the “hungry guys” inconsequential. That history gives Bayer’s character’s liberation and sexual awakening much more weight. (Yes, I realize how ridiculous that sounds.) When the Sabine character asks her name, Bayer correctly responds: “I’ve never had one.” And while for two years her sweater-clad, smiling wife has subverted her own wants and desires for the needs of her “hungry guys,” this time, it’s <em>her</em> desires driving the ship.</p>\n<p>Once again, this may all sound like over-thinking a silly <em>S.N.L.</em> sketch. But with the show growing increasingly political (thanks, in no small part to <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/08/saturday-night-live-gay-jokes-kate-mckinnon\">newly-minted</a> head writers <strong>Chris Kelly</strong> and <strong>Sarah Schneider</strong>&#8212;a gay man and a woman), we shouldn’t dismiss the influence of recent events like the <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/01/womens-march-on-washington-turnout\">Women’s March</a> and Saturday’s <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/thousands-in-lgbtq-community-protest-trump-at-historic-stonewall-inn_us_5895faa2e4b09bd304bba329\">Stonewall Protest</a> on the sketch.</p>\n<p>At least one person agrees that this was a brilliant twist on an <em>S.N.L.</em> classic.

Back in 2012&#8212;when the presidency was just a glimmer in Trump’s eye&#8212;he got (<em>way too</em>) involved in the public breakup of Stewart and her then-boyfriend, <strong>Robert Pattinson</strong> and publicly shamed her on Twitter. Those tweets&#8212;as well as Stewart’s sexuality&#8212;played a part in her droll, well-executed monologue. But it may all be overshadowed thanks to Stewart’s slip-up right at the end. In a move that has gotten cast members <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/28321-jenny-slates-non-apology-for-snl-f-bomb-is-pretty-badass\">in major trouble in the past</a>, Stewart dropped an accidental f-bomb. “Well, I’ll never be back!” she said with an embarrassed grin.</p>\n<p>But if all we talk about is one errant swear word, it will be a shame. Because before her slip-up, Stewart&#8212;not best-known for her comedic stylings&#8212;was doing a killer job. The backstory she gave about Trump calling her out on Twitter? Entirely true. In fact, Trump has <em>still</em> not deleted those tweets.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/258640349872926720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/258640349872926720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/258640349872926720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</a></p></blockquote></div><p>The future president really let Stewart have it in a series of tweets that stretched over several weeks in 2012. With one last <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/268416910595600384\">message</a> (“After Friday’s <em>Twilight</em> release, I hope Robert Pattinson will not be seen in public with Kristen&#8212;she will cheat on him again!”) Trump&#8212;a <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/09/trump-files-listen-donald-brag-about-his-affairs-while-pretending-be-someone-else\">known philanderer himself</a>&#8212;finally dropped the subject. But Trump’s infidelity double standard, which came with a dash of slut shaming, was an early indicator of the tone of his presidential campaign&#8212;one that would, in the words of <strong>Aziz Ansari</strong> in <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/aziz-ansari-monologue-saturday-night-live-racist-lowercase-kkk-donald-trump\">his recent <em>S.N.L.</em> monologue</a>, inspire “an entire gender” to protest.</p>\n<p>But in <em>her</em> monologue, Stewart diagnosed the problem differently. Trump, she guessed, was more preoccupied with (a.k.a. in love with) Pattinson than he was with her. And with that big gay segue, Stewart also was a bit more <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/film/news/kristen-stewart-cannes-ilm-festival-twilight-1201769327/\">publicly frank</a> about her own sexuality than she has been in the past.</p>\n<noscript></noscript><p>Stewart was soon joined on stage by out, lesbian cast member <strong>Kate McKinnon</strong> and a butched-up version of <strong>Aidy Bryant</strong> for what was, surely, the queerest moment in <em>S.N.L.</em> history. (That is, until the super-gay fake Super Bowl commercial Stewart participated in later.)</p>\n<p>Stewart is just the latest in a string of <em>S.N.L.</em> hosts seemingly plucked <em>just</em> to rile Trump, The last host, Ansari, didn’t have an upcoming project to promote; nor, really, did Stewart. (She made reference to this by joking that <em>Twilight</em> had been on iTunes for eight years as of this month, though her film <em>Personal Shopper</em> does open in March.)  Next up? The most Trump-riling host of all: <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong>.</p>","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Television","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"hallable":true},"revisionAuthor":"Hillary Busis","hed":"<em>S.N.L.</em>: Watch as Kristen Stewart’s Accidental F-Bomb Overshadows a Fiery, Gay, Anti-Trump Monologue","_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1440,"height":960,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/02/05/5896b8939d7a7cd341e5b7de_k-stew-swearing.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"February 5, 2017 12:30 am","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Joanna Robinson","filename":"k-stew-swearing.jpg","title":"k-stew-swearing.jpg","id":"5896b8939d7a7cd341e5b7df","createdAt":"February 5, 2017 12:30 am","modifiedAt":"February 5, 2017 12:30 am","modelName":"photo"}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionCreatedAt":"April 22, 2016 1:58 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"contributors","modelName":"contributor","publishable":true,"identifiable":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","bio":"Joanna Robinson is a Hollywood writer covering TV and film for VanityFair.com.

Among all the greatest Trump hits, there was a slick little German language joke. Baldwin’s Trump claimed that he was working on his memoir, which would be called “My Struggle,” and asked McKinnon’s Merkel what that would be called in German.

Back in 2012&#8212;when the presidency was just a glimmer in Trump’s eye&#8212;he got (<em>way too</em>) involved in the public breakup of Stewart and her then-boyfriend, <strong>Robert Pattinson</strong> and publicly shamed her on Twitter. Those tweets&#8212;as well as Stewart’s sexuality&#8212;played a part in her droll, well-executed monologue. But it may all be overshadowed thanks to Stewart’s slip-up right at the end. In a move that has gotten cast members <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/28321-jenny-slates-non-apology-for-snl-f-bomb-is-pretty-badass\">in major trouble in the past</a>, Stewart dropped an accidental f-bomb. “Well, I’ll never be back!” she said with an embarrassed grin.</p>\n<p>But if all we talk about is one errant swear word, it will be a shame. Because before her slip-up, Stewart&#8212;not best-known for her comedic stylings&#8212;was doing a killer job. The backstory she gave about Trump calling her out on Twitter? Entirely true. In fact, Trump has <em>still</em> not deleted those tweets.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/258640349872926720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/258640349872926720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/258640349872926720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</a></p></blockquote></div><p>The future president really let Stewart have it in a series of tweets that stretched over several weeks in 2012. With one last <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/268416910595600384\">message</a> (“After Friday’s <em>Twilight</em> release, I hope Robert Pattinson will not be seen in public with Kristen&#8212;she will cheat on him again!”) Trump&#8212;a <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/09/trump-files-listen-donald-brag-about-his-affairs-while-pretending-be-someone-else\">known philanderer himself</a>&#8212;finally dropped the subject. But Trump’s infidelity double standard, which came with a dash of slut shaming, was an early indicator of the tone of his presidential campaign&#8212;one that would, in the words of <strong>Aziz Ansari</strong> in <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/aziz-ansari-monologue-saturday-night-live-racist-lowercase-kkk-donald-trump\">his recent <em>S.N.L.</em> monologue</a>, inspire “an entire gender” to protest.</p>\n<p>But in <em>her</em> monologue, Stewart diagnosed the problem differently. Trump, she guessed, was more preoccupied with (a.k.a. in love with) Pattinson than he was with her. And with that big gay segue, Stewart also was a bit more <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/film/news/kristen-stewart-cannes-ilm-festival-twilight-1201769327/\">publicly frank</a> about her own sexuality than she has been in the past.</p>\n<noscript></noscript><p>Stewart was soon joined on stage by out, lesbian cast member <strong>Kate McKinnon</strong> and a butched-up version of <strong>Aidy Bryant</strong> for what was, surely, the queerest moment in <em>S.N.L.</em> history. (That is, until the super-gay fake Super Bowl commercial Stewart participated in later.)</p>\n<p>Stewart is just the latest in a string of <em>S.N.L.</em> hosts seemingly plucked <em>just</em> to rile Trump, The last host, Ansari, didn’t have an upcoming project to promote; nor, really, did Stewart. (She made reference to this by joking that <em>Twilight</em> had been on iTunes for eight years as of this month, though her film <em>Personal Shopper</em> does open in March.)  Next up?

But after <strong>Mikey Day</strong> sunk his skeletal fingers into <strong>Steve Bannon</strong> at the top of the episode, <em>S.N.L.</em> essentially doubled down with a <em>second</em> cold-open-esque sketch. This time it was <strong>Melissa McCarthy’s</strong> turn to rip into Press Secretary <strong>Sean Spicer</strong> and the famously physical comedienne (and frequent <em>S.N.L.</em> host) did it with gusto.</p>\n<noscript></noscript><p>Having fun with Spicer’s <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/01/sean-spicer-inauguration-statement-lies\">instantly caustic</a> dynamic with the White House press corps, McCarthy channeled some of her more bombastic comedic characters in order to rip journalists to shreds from her bully pulpit.

McCarthy closed out the sketch with a shouted “Live from New York!” reminding the audience that the episode was double-dipping on classic cold open material. It’s almost as if <em>Saturday Night Live</em> has figured out that much of its audience is tuning in <em>just</em> to see how the show will trash the president. McCarthy’s glorious, kinetic impression is just one more weapon in <em>S.N.L.’s</em> arsenal against the Trump administration&#8212;and with <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong> hosting next week, the <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/alec-baldwin-host-saturday-night-live-donald-trump\">next episode could consist <em>entirely</em> of sketches like this one</a>.</p>","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Television","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"hallable":true},"revisionAuthor":"Hillary Busis","hed":"<em>S.N.L.</em>: Watch Melissa McCarthy Debut an Explosively Violent Sean Spicer Impression","_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1440,"height":960,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/02/05/5896be85b9ae9c605ed18b07_sean-spicer.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"February 5, 2017 12:56 am","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Joanna Robinson","filename":"sean-spicer.jpg","_embedded":{"photosTout":[],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[]},"title":"sean-spicer.jpg","_links":{},"id":"5896be85b9ae9c605ed18b08","createdAt":"February 5, 2017 12:56 am","modifiedAt":"February 5, 2017 12:56 am","modelName":"photo"}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionCreatedAt":"April 22, 2016 1:58 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"contributors","modelName":"contributor","publishable":true,"identifiable":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","bio":"Joanna Robinson is a Hollywood writer covering TV and film for VanityFair.com.

Frequent guest <strong>John Goodman</strong> got <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/12/snl-trump-alec-baldwin-putin-john-goodman-vanity-fair-kanye\">early dibs</a> on <strong>Secretary of State Rex Tillerson</strong>.

Among all the greatest Trump hits, there was a slick little German language joke. Baldwin’s Trump claimed that he was working on his memoir, which would be called “My Struggle,” and asked McKinnon’s Merkel what that would be called in German.

Back in 2012&#8212;when the presidency was just a glimmer in Trump’s eye&#8212;he got (<em>way too</em>) involved in the public breakup of Stewart and her then-boyfriend, <strong>Robert Pattinson</strong> and publicly shamed her on Twitter. Those tweets&#8212;as well as Stewart’s sexuality&#8212;played a part in her droll, well-executed monologue. But it may all be overshadowed thanks to Stewart’s slip-up right at the end. In a move that has gotten cast members <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/28321-jenny-slates-non-apology-for-snl-f-bomb-is-pretty-badass\">in major trouble in the past</a>, Stewart dropped an accidental f-bomb. “Well, I’ll never be back!” she said with an embarrassed grin.</p>\n<p>But if all we talk about is one errant swear word, it will be a shame. Because before her slip-up, Stewart&#8212;not best-known for her comedic stylings&#8212;was doing a killer job. The backstory she gave about Trump calling her out on Twitter? Entirely true. In fact, Trump has <em>still</em> not deleted those tweets.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/258640349872926720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/258640349872926720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/258640349872926720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</a></p></blockquote></div><p>The future president really let Stewart have it in a series of tweets that stretched over several weeks in 2012. With one last <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/268416910595600384\">message</a> (“After Friday’s <em>Twilight</em> release, I hope Robert Pattinson will not be seen in public with Kristen&#8212;she will cheat on him again!”) Trump&#8212;a <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/09/trump-files-listen-donald-brag-about-his-affairs-while-pretending-be-someone-else\">known philanderer himself</a>&#8212;finally dropped the subject. But Trump’s infidelity double standard, which came with a dash of slut shaming, was an early indicator of the tone of his presidential campaign&#8212;one that would, in the words of <strong>Aziz Ansari</strong> in <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/aziz-ansari-monologue-saturday-night-live-racist-lowercase-kkk-donald-trump\">his recent <em>S.N.L.</em> monologue</a>, inspire “an entire gender” to protest.</p>\n<p>But in <em>her</em> monologue, Stewart diagnosed the problem differently. Trump, she guessed, was more preoccupied with (a.k.a. in love with) Pattinson than he was with her. And with that big gay segue, Stewart also was a bit more <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/film/news/kristen-stewart-cannes-ilm-festival-twilight-1201769327/\">publicly frank</a> about her own sexuality than she has been in the past.</p>\n<noscript></noscript><p>Stewart was soon joined on stage by out, lesbian cast member <strong>Kate McKinnon</strong> and a butched-up version of <strong>Aidy Bryant</strong> for what was, surely, the queerest moment in <em>S.N.L.</em> history. (That is, until the super-gay fake Super Bowl commercial Stewart participated in later.)</p>\n<p>Stewart is just the latest in a string of <em>S.N.L.</em> hosts seemingly plucked <em>just</em> to rile Trump, The last host, Ansari, didn’t have an upcoming project to promote; nor, really, did Stewart. (She made reference to this by joking that <em>Twilight</em> had been on iTunes for eight years as of this month, though her film <em>Personal Shopper</em> does open in March.)  Next up? The most Trump-riling host of all: <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong>.</p>","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Television","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"hallable":true},"revisionAuthor":"Hillary Busis","hed":"<em>S.N.L.</em>: Watch as Kristen Stewart’s Accidental F-Bomb Overshadows a Fiery, Gay, Anti-Trump Monologue","_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1440,"height":960,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/02/05/5896b8939d7a7cd341e5b7de_k-stew-swearing.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"February 5, 2017 12:30 am","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Joanna Robinson","filename":"k-stew-swearing.jpg","title":"k-stew-swearing.jpg","id":"5896b8939d7a7cd341e5b7df","createdAt":"February 5, 2017 12:30 am","modifiedAt":"February 5, 2017 12:30 am","modelName":"photo"}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionCreatedAt":"April 22, 2016 1:58 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"contributors","modelName":"contributor","publishable":true,"identifiable":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","bio":"Joanna Robinson is a Hollywood writer covering TV and film for VanityFair.com.

Among all the greatest Trump hits, there was a slick little German language joke. Baldwin’s Trump claimed that he was working on his memoir, which would be called “My Struggle,” and asked McKinnon’s Merkel what that would be called in German.

Back in 2012&#8212;when the presidency was just a glimmer in Trump’s eye&#8212;he got (<em>way too</em>) involved in the public breakup of Stewart and her then-boyfriend, <strong>Robert Pattinson</strong> and publicly shamed her on Twitter. Those tweets&#8212;as well as Stewart’s sexuality&#8212;played a part in her droll, well-executed monologue. But it may all be overshadowed thanks to Stewart’s slip-up right at the end. In a move that has gotten cast members <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/28321-jenny-slates-non-apology-for-snl-f-bomb-is-pretty-badass\">in major trouble in the past</a>, Stewart dropped an accidental f-bomb. “Well, I’ll never be back!” she said with an embarrassed grin.</p>\n<p>But if all we talk about is one errant swear word, it will be a shame. Because before her slip-up, Stewart&#8212;not best-known for her comedic stylings&#8212;was doing a killer job. The backstory she gave about Trump calling her out on Twitter? Entirely true. In fact, Trump has <em>still</em> not deleted those tweets.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/258640349872926720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/258640349872926720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/258640349872926720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</a></p></blockquote></div><p>The future president really let Stewart have it in a series of tweets that stretched over several weeks in 2012. With one last <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/268416910595600384\">message</a> (“After Friday’s <em>Twilight</em> release, I hope Robert Pattinson will not be seen in public with Kristen&#8212;she will cheat on him again!”) Trump&#8212;a <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/09/trump-files-listen-donald-brag-about-his-affairs-while-pretending-be-someone-else\">known philanderer himself</a>&#8212;finally dropped the subject. But Trump’s infidelity double standard, which came with a dash of slut shaming, was an early indicator of the tone of his presidential campaign&#8212;one that would, in the words of <strong>Aziz Ansari</strong> in <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/aziz-ansari-monologue-saturday-night-live-racist-lowercase-kkk-donald-trump\">his recent <em>S.N.L.</em> monologue</a>, inspire “an entire gender” to protest.</p>\n<p>But in <em>her</em> monologue, Stewart diagnosed the problem differently. Trump, she guessed, was more preoccupied with (a.k.a. in love with) Pattinson than he was with her. And with that big gay segue, Stewart also was a bit more <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/film/news/kristen-stewart-cannes-ilm-festival-twilight-1201769327/\">publicly frank</a> about her own sexuality than she has been in the past.</p>\n<noscript></noscript><p>Stewart was soon joined on stage by out, lesbian cast member <strong>Kate McKinnon</strong> and a butched-up version of <strong>Aidy Bryant</strong> for what was, surely, the queerest moment in <em>S.N.L.</em> history. (That is, until the super-gay fake Super Bowl commercial Stewart participated in later.)</p>\n<p>Stewart is just the latest in a string of <em>S.N.L.</em> hosts seemingly plucked <em>just</em> to rile Trump, The last host, Ansari, didn’t have an upcoming project to promote; nor, really, did Stewart. (She made reference to this by joking that <em>Twilight</em> had been on iTunes for eight years as of this month, though her film <em>Personal Shopper</em> does open in March.)  Next up?

Sources close to <strong>Donald Trump</strong> told <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/melissa-mccarthy-sean-spicer-234715\"><em>Politico</em></a> on Monday that Trump was not a fan of the bit&#8212;and “more than being lampooned as a press secretary who makes up facts, it was Spicer’s portrayal by a woman” that bothered the president the most.

His advice? McCarthy &quot;needs to slow down on the gum chewing; way too many pieces in there.&quot; Though he said he thought it was a &quot;really funny&quot;show, he said McCarthy &quot;could dial back a bit,” the syndicated news series reported. But Spicer\nis <em>really</em> not a fan of the way the show’s been treating his boss: <strong>Alec Baldwin’s</strong> famous <strong>Donald Trump</strong> impression “has gone from funny to mean, and that’s unfortunate,” Spicer told <em>Extra,</em> “<em>S.N.L.</em> used to be really funny. There’s a streak of meanness now that they’ve crossed over to mean.”</p>\n<p>After the episode aired, McCarthy’s sketch quickly went viral.

Surprisingly fine, according to an interview published Thursday in <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/a-conversation-kellyanne-conway-im-face-trumps-movement-968579\"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a>.</p>\n<p>It’s unclear from the interview whether Conway has seen the sketch show’s latest salvo against her; at least, she doesn’t refer to it directly, either in the interview or a brief video that accompanies it. What is clear, though, is that Conway, <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/12/snl-donald-trump-alec-baldwin-retweets\">like her boss</a>, is intimately familiar with the way <em>S.N.L.</em> has portrayed her in the past. And perhaps predictably, she was more fond of McKinnon’s impression when it was a little less savage.</p>\n<p>When asked what she thought of McKinnon’s Kellyanne, the real Kellyanne responded in the video that she wished the show would “make [its Kellyanne] a little bit more happy. I’m known as much more happy than maybe the character sometimes is.” She added that she <em>was</em> a fan of <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/10/saturday-night-live-kellyanne-conway-sketch\">“Kellyanne Conway’s Day Off” </a>, a sketch from the fall of 2016 that cast McKinnon’s Conway as a long-suffering Trump cog constantly called upon to put out fires&#8212;and incapable of enjoying even a moment of peace. “That was much more me,” said Conway.</p>\n<p>All told, though, the woman <strong>Samantha Bee</strong> <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/samantha-bee-kellyanne-conway-president-donald-trump\">recently called</a> “the soulless Machiavellian despot America deserves” seems pretty unruffled by <em>S.N.L.</em> After all, as an <a href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/01/unearthed-video-shows-kellyanne-conway-doing-stand-up-comedy.html\">experienced stand-up</a> herself, Conway knows a thing or two about comedy&#8212;and more importantly, as a <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/seth-meyers-kellyanne-conway-donald-trump-late-night\">gifted spin master</a>, she can find a way to make even the most dire situation sound positive. And in this case, Conway didn’t even have to work very hard to get there: “Kate McKinnon clearly sees the road to the future runs through me and not Hillary,” she told <em>T.H.R.</em> Even <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/243259-kate-mckinnon-obviously-rooting-for-hillary\">avowed Clinton supporter</a> McKinnon might have to agree with that.</p>\n<noscript></noscript>","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Television","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"hallable":true},"revisionAuthor":"Hillary Busis","hed":"Kellyanne Conway Has Just One Complaint About Kate McKinnon’s <em>Saturday Night Live</em> Impression","_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1440,"height":960,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/01/26/588a2abaf4fa7b2b123e5e15_kate-mckinnon-kellyanne-conway.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"January 26, 2017 11:59 am","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Hillary Busis","filename":"kate-mckinnon-kellyanne-conway.jpg","title":"NUP_177027_0004.JPG","tags":[],"credit":"From NBC/Getty Images.","id":"588a2abaf4fa7b2b123e5e16","createdAt":"January 26, 2017 11:58 am","revision":1,"modifiedAt":"January 26, 2017 11:59 am","description":"632411468","modelName":"photo"}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionCreatedAt":"December 1, 2016 5:01 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"contributors","modelName":"contributor","publishable":true,"identifiable":true},"revisionAuthor":"Hillary Busis","bio":"Hillary Busis is the Hollywood editor at VanityFair.com.

Last weekend, host <strong>Aziz Ansari</strong> <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/aziz-ansari-monologue-saturday-night-live-racist-lowercase-kkk-donald-trump\">weighed in on</a> the rising trend of racism in the U.S., as well as Trump’s responsibility, as president, to heal a fractured nation. For its next episode, the show has hired <strong>Kristen Stewart</strong>&#8212;an <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/kristen-stewart-saturday-night-live-donald-trump\">outspoken star who was once the target of Trump’s online bullying</a>. And for February 11&#8212;historically a Valentine’s-themed show&#8212;<em>S.N.L.</em> has devised the perfect love letter to its fans, in the form of their presidential impersonator and trusty <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/snl-donald-trump-alec-baldwin-pee-pee-party\">Trump teaser</a>: <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/ditzkoff/status/823577635771052033\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ditzkoff/status/823577635771052033\">https://twitter.com/ditzkoff/status/823577635771052033</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Baldwin, of course, is one of <em>S.N.L.’s</em> most frequent hosts. He has become even more of a staple this season, cropping up to lampoon Trump in nearly every episode. Baldwin has adopted his role as annoyance in chief with gusto: <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/alec-baldwin-donald-trump-inauguration-rally\">needling</a> the president <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/12/donald-trump-inauguration-alec-baldwin\">every chance</a> he can get, Baldwin even showed up in person outside Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York City last Thursday to do his <a href=\"http://ew.com/news/2017/01/19/donald-trump-alec-baldwin-impression-rally/\">impression</a> for a crowd of anti-Trump protestors. There’s also talk of Baldwin <a href=\"http://tvline.com/2017/01/11/alec-baldwin-donald-trump-saturday-night-live-other-venues/\">expanding his impression</a> into a mysterious project outside of <em>S.N.L.</em>’s Studio 8H.</p>\n<p>But first, it seems, we may get an idea of exactly how much of Baldwin’s Trump we can stand at any given time. The February 11 episode will allow the show’s writers to dream up presidential sketches that stretch beyond the cold open and the occasional pre-taped segment. Could we be in for an <em>entire</em> Trump episode? Would that be too much of a good thing?</p>\n<p>Even if Baldwin doesn’t do any more than his usual amount of Trump, longtime fans of <em>S.N.L.</em> know we’re likely in for a treat. In September 2011, Baldwin beat <strong>Steve Martin’s</strong> record to become the most frequent host in the show’s long history. (Baldwin has hosted 16 times, Martin only 15.) Though Martin and possibly other <em>S.N.L.</em> stalwarts like <strong>Tom Hanks</strong> and Baldwin’s old boss, <strong>Tina Fey</strong>, will show up for a cameo or two. The upcoming show will be lucky number 17 for Baldwin; at this point, really, they should just make him an honorary member of the cast.</p>\n<p><strong>Video: How to Survive Donald Trump’s Presidency</strong></p>\n<div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/embedjs/588149abfd2e611466000039/51cc9f86bb8f554e4e000002.js?autoplay=1&amp;muted=1\"></div>","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Television","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"hallable":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","hed":"Alec Baldwin Will Get an Entire <em>Saturday Night Live</em> Episode to Make Fun of Trump","_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1440,"height":960,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/09/28/57ec25b0a8e32b23a1a4273f_t-donald-trump-alec-baldwin-snl.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"September 28, 2016 4:18 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Benjamin Park","filename":"t-donald-trump-alec-baldwin-snl.jpg","title":"t-donald-trump-alec-baldwin-snl.jpg","id":"57ec25b075f9c0a12314ae1e","createdAt":"September 28, 2016 4:18 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"September 28, 2016 4:18 pm","modelName":"photo"}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionCreatedAt":"April 22, 2016 1:58 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"contributors","modelName":"contributor","publishable":true,"identifiable":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","bio":"Joanna Robinson is a Hollywood writer covering TV and film for VanityFair.com.

On Saturday, McCarthy did a <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/02/melissa-mccarthy-saturday-night-live-sean-spicer-impression\">bruising, hilarious impression</a> of the beleagured White House press secretary, portraying him as a highly combative, gum-guzzling extremist. In an interview with <a href=\"http://extratv.com/2017/02/05/white-house-press-secretary-sean-spicer-reacts-to-melissa-mccarthys-snl-skit/\"><em>Extra</em></a> on Sunday, Spicer said that while he was amused by the sketch, to some extent, he still had a few bones to pick with the show.</p>\n<p>Spicer told <em>Extra</em> that McCarthy’s spoof was a little exaggerated. His advice? McCarthy &quot;needs to slow down on the gum chewing; way too many pieces in there.&quot; Though he said he thought it was a &quot;really funny&quot;show, he said McCarthy &quot;could dial back a bit,” the syndicated news series reported. But Spicer\nis <em>really</em> not a fan of the way the show’s been treating his boss: <strong>Alec Baldwin’s</strong> famous <strong>Donald Trump</strong> impression “has gone from funny to mean, and that’s unfortunate,” Spicer told <em>Extra,</em> “<em>S.N.L.</em> used to be really funny.

At first, the show depicted Conway&#8212;played by longtime cast M.V.P. <strong>Kate McKinnon</strong>, who also plays <em>S.N.L.</em>’s take on <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong>&#8212;as a harried Trump booster looking for a way out of the future president’s inner circle. All that changed last Saturday, though, when <em>S.N.L.</em> ran an <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/kellyanne-conway-alternative-facts-snl-parody-chicago-kate-mckinnon\">instantly viral sketch</a> that cast Conway as a power-drunk spotlight-hogger, someone ready to make the shift from Svengali to star.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block video row\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><iframe height=\"360\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sb9ybImGwkU\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allowtransparency=\"true\"> </iframe></div></div><p>How, exactly, does the <em>real</em> Kellyanne Conway feel about this tectonic shift? Surprisingly fine, according to an interview published Thursday in <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/a-conversation-kellyanne-conway-im-face-trumps-movement-968579\"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a>.</p>\n<p>It’s unclear from the interview whether Conway has seen the sketch show’s latest salvo against her; at least, she doesn’t refer to it directly, either in the interview or a brief video that accompanies it. What is clear, though, is that Conway, <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/12/snl-donald-trump-alec-baldwin-retweets\">like her boss</a>, is intimately familiar with the way <em>S.N.L.</em> has portrayed her in the past. And perhaps predictably, she was more fond of McKinnon’s impression when it was a little less savage.</p>\n<p>When asked what she thought of McKinnon’s Kellyanne, the real Kellyanne responded in the video that she wished the show would “make [its Kellyanne] a little bit more happy. I’m known as much more happy than maybe the character sometimes is.” She added that she <em>was</em> a fan of <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/10/saturday-night-live-kellyanne-conway-sketch\">“Kellyanne Conway’s Day Off” </a>, a sketch from the fall of 2016 that cast McKinnon’s Conway as a long-suffering Trump cog constantly called upon to put out fires&#8212;and incapable of enjoying even a moment of peace. “That was much more me,” said Conway.</p>\n<p>All told, though, the woman <strong>Samantha Bee</strong> <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/samantha-bee-kellyanne-conway-president-donald-trump\">recently called</a> “the soulless Machiavellian despot America deserves” seems pretty unruffled by <em>S.N.L.</em> After all, as an <a href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/01/unearthed-video-shows-kellyanne-conway-doing-stand-up-comedy.html\">experienced stand-up</a> herself, Conway knows a thing or two about comedy&#8212;and more importantly, as a <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/seth-meyers-kellyanne-conway-donald-trump-late-night\">gifted spin master</a>, she can find a way to make even the most dire situation sound positive. And in this case, Conway didn’t even have to work very hard to get there: “Kate McKinnon clearly sees the road to the future runs through me and not Hillary,” she told <em>T.H.R.</em> Even <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/243259-kate-mckinnon-obviously-rooting-for-hillary\">avowed Clinton supporter</a> McKinnon might have to agree with that.</p>\n<noscript></noscript>","channel":"Hollywood","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"57435229c1f81aa45c8117e7","modelName":"contributor","bio":"Hillary Busis is the Hollywood editor at VanityFair.com.

Last weekend, host <strong>Aziz Ansari</strong> <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/aziz-ansari-monologue-saturday-night-live-racist-lowercase-kkk-donald-trump\">weighed in on</a> the rising trend of racism in the U.S., as well as Trump’s responsibility, as president, to heal a fractured nation. For its next episode, the show has hired <strong>Kristen Stewart</strong>&#8212;an <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/kristen-stewart-saturday-night-live-donald-trump\">outspoken star who was once the target of Trump’s online bullying</a>. And for February 11&#8212;historically a Valentine’s-themed show&#8212;<em>S.N.L.</em> has devised the perfect love letter to its fans, in the form of their presidential impersonator and trusty <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/snl-donald-trump-alec-baldwin-pee-pee-party\">Trump teaser</a>: <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/ditzkoff/status/823577635771052033\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ditzkoff/status/823577635771052033\">https://twitter.com/ditzkoff/status/823577635771052033</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Baldwin, of course, is one of <em>S.N.L.’s</em> most frequent hosts. He has become even more of a staple this season, cropping up to lampoon Trump in nearly every episode. Baldwin has adopted his role as annoyance in chief with gusto: <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/alec-baldwin-donald-trump-inauguration-rally\">needling</a> the president <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/12/donald-trump-inauguration-alec-baldwin\">every chance</a> he can get, Baldwin even showed up in person outside Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York City last Thursday to do his <a href=\"http://ew.com/news/2017/01/19/donald-trump-alec-baldwin-impression-rally/\">impression</a> for a crowd of anti-Trump protestors. There’s also talk of Baldwin <a href=\"http://tvline.com/2017/01/11/alec-baldwin-donald-trump-saturday-night-live-other-venues/\">expanding his impression</a> into a mysterious project outside of <em>S.N.L.</em>’s Studio 8H.</p>\n<p>But first, it seems, we may get an idea of exactly how much of Baldwin’s Trump we can stand at any given time. The February 11 episode will allow the show’s writers to dream up presidential sketches that stretch beyond the cold open and the occasional pre-taped segment. Could we be in for an <em>entire</em> Trump episode? Would that be too much of a good thing?</p>\n<p>Even if Baldwin doesn’t do any more than his usual amount of Trump, longtime fans of <em>S.N.L.</em> know we’re likely in for a treat. In September 2011, Baldwin beat <strong>Steve Martin’s</strong> record to become the most frequent host in the show’s long history. (Baldwin has hosted 16 times, Martin only 15.) Though Martin and possibly other <em>S.N.L.</em> stalwarts like <strong>Tom Hanks</strong> and Baldwin’s old boss, <strong>Tina Fey</strong>, will show up for a cameo or two. The upcoming show will be lucky number 17 for Baldwin; at this point, really, they should just make him an honorary member of the cast.</p>\n<p><strong>Video: How to Survive Donald Trump’s Presidency</strong></p>\n<div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/embedjs/588149abfd2e611466000039/51cc9f86bb8f554e4e000002.js?autoplay=1&amp;muted=1\"></div>","channel":"Hollywood","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"52d583dbbccdc918230000b7","modelName":"contributor","bio":"Joanna Robinson is a Hollywood writer covering TV and film for VanityFair.com.
