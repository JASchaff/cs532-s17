If you missed this story last week, Donald Trump's former campaign manager and now adviser Kellyanne Conway caused a stir when during a televised interview she referenced a "massacre" while attempting to justify the President's ban on refugees and immigrants.


 


She
 said
:


 


“
I bet it’s brand new information to people that President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. Most people don’t know that because it didn’t get covered
.”


 


Well, turns out that it didn't get covered because it didn't happen. And Stephen Colbert used this gaffe, that she repeated in other interviews, to absolutely mock the living daylights out of her. It's actually a massacre.
