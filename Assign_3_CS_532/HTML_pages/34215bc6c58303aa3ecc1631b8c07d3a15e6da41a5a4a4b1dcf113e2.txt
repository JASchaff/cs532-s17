Five Reasons Betsy DeVos as Education Secretary Could Be a Total Disaster

Betsy DeVos, Trump’s pick for secretary of education, has been, well, 
controversial
. But despite a huge push from the left to block her nomination, and the fact that two Republican senators have gone against the grain to say they&apos;ll 
vote against her
, it looks like DeVos is headed for confirmation today.
Hopefully, she&apos;ll prove us all wrong and be a stunning success. It could happen! But we kind of doubt it. Here&apos;s why:
1. Her pet projects actually divert money away from public schools.
This is a big issue for the person who is supposed to be in charge of public schools.
Her main work within the education world has been as a philanthropist and activist, mainly for school-voucher programs (which give parents public money to pay for tuition at private schools) and charter schools (independent schools that are funded using public money but aren’t held to many of the same rules and regulations as most public schools) in her home state of Michigan.
In Michigan DeVos and her family spent $1.45 million fighting oversight for charter schools, which could mean that bad charter schools are left to operate without being held accountable by the government. In a statement the 
ACLU of Michigan
 said this about DeVos: “She has ardently supported the unlimited, unregulated growth of charter schools in Michigan, elevating for-profit schools with no consideration of the severe harm done to traditional public schools. She’s done this despite overwhelming evidence that proves that charters do no better at educating children than traditional public schools and serve only to exacerbate funding problems for cash-strapped public districts.”
Proponents of charter schools and vouchers—including President Trump—say these programs give poor students the ability to make choices about where they want to go to school. But opponents argue that they funnel money out of the public education system, leaving public schools to languish with even fewer resources than before. And research has shown that neither charter schools or vouchers improve students’ performance in a significant way.
2. She has virtually no experience with public education.
DeVos herself only attended private schools, and sends her children to private school. She didn’t work as an educator, or in education policy. She never studied education in school.
And that’s really unusual. Obama’s most recent education secretary, John King, had a Ph.D. in education, and spent years working in schools and in education policy. Obama’s first education secretary, Arne Duncan, was the CEO of Chicago Public Schools. Before George W. Bush selected Margaret Spellings as education secretary, she worked in education reform and was the president of the University of North Carolina.
3. She has a ton of unresolved ethics issues.
In a column on 
The Hill
, ethics advisers for Presidents Obama and George W. Bush examined her financial interests and concluded that “seldom have we seen a worse cabinet-level ethics mess.”
Exhibit A: DeVos and her husband are the main backers of a biotech company called Neurocore, which treats kids with ADHD, and promote the company on the website for their investment management company. If she becomes education secretary, that could be perceived as an endorsement from the government, an obvious conflict. Also, DeVos has 
reportedly failed
 to release details of some of her financial ties, even though they were requested by the Senate, which means there could be even bigger issues we don’t even know about.
She’s been shady about her finances in other ways too. At her confirmation hearing, when asked about the $5.2 million her family foundation gave to groups that perform 
gay-conversion therapy
, DeVos denied that she was affiliated with the foundation, even though she was listed as a board member on federal tax forms—for 
17 years
. How does she explain that discrepancy? A clerical error.
4. Her confirmation hearing was a mess.
DeVos betrayed a lack of basic understanding of the education system, dodged some simple questions, fudged answers to others, and talked about grizzly bears. It’s no wonder her confirmation hearing has been 
mocked
 and 
meme-ified
.
5. When this 
SNL
 clip is dead-on, you have to wonder whether the person in question is fit for the job.
“Well, yes, I don’t know anything about school. But I do think there should be a school. Probably Jesus school. And I do think it should have walls. And roof. And gun for potential grizzly.”
The worst part is that she actually said the thing about having guns in schools to guard against grizzly bears.
