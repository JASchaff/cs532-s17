With a single tie-breaking "Aye" and a bang of the gavel, philanthropist and school choice activist Betsy DeVos became the newest U.S. secretary of education.






I appreciate the Senate's diligence & am honored to serve as 
@usedgov
 Secretary. Let's improve options & outcomes for all US students.


‚Äî Betsy DeVos (@BetsyDeVos) 
February 7, 2017






Naturally, there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth
 as acolytes of the government school monopoly started losing it almost instantly. Social media abounded 140-character manifestos of woe, outrage, and other school choice-hating bile, as visions of schoolhouse-free dystopias ran rampant in the anti-educational freedom hive mind.


But worry not, ye unhinged haters of liberty, there‚Äôs still a way to keep Betsy Devos from having any sway whatsoever over public education in the United States. And a libertarian congressman from Kentucky knows just how to do it.


As the upper chamber geared up for the historic 51-50 education secretary vote, a measure to abolish her new place of employment was introduced in the House of Representatives. Sponsored by 
Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. (A, 94%)
, H.R. 899 would shutter the doors at DeVos‚Äô new office ‚Äì and thus the heated debate over her employment ‚Äì at the end of the 2018 calendar year.


"Unelected bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. should not be in charge of our children‚Äôs intellectual and moral development,‚Äù reads a 
press release
 from Massie‚Äôs office. ‚ÄúStates and local communities are best positioned to shape curricula that meet the needs of their students. Schools should be accountable. Parents have the right to choose the most appropriate educational opportunity for their children, including home school, public school, or private school."


The bill is currently co-sponsored by a handful of other GOP members, including 
Reps. Justin Amash, R-Mich. (A, 96%)
, 
Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah (C, 78%)
, and 
Raul Labrador, R-Idaho (A, 93%)
.


‚ÄúD.C. bureaucrats cannot begin to understand the needs of schools and its students on an individual basis,‚Äù reads a 
statement
 from co-sponsor 
Walter Jones, R-N.C. (C, 76%)
. ‚ÄúIt is time that we get the feds out of the classroom, and terminate the Department of Education.‚Äù


Since so many are concerned about a friend of school potentially making cabinet-level decisions on education, and since grassroots conservatives still have so much reason to be wary of Betsy DeVos‚Äô record on Common Core, perhaps now might be a good time to finally accomplish what 
President Reagan started over 30 years ago
, and get rid of the Department of Education once and for all.


Editor‚Äôs Note: In a previous version of this piece the states for Reps. Jason Chaffetz and Raul Labrador were incorrectly listed. The error has been corrected.
