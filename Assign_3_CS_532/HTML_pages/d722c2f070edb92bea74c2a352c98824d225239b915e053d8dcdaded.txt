Celebrities: We can't confirm Devos! She'll destroy the public school system that I refuse to put my children through.

Wealthy liberal entertainers — who, we’d bet good money, prefer 
not
 to send their own children to public schools — are apoplectic.

Betsy DeVos confirmed. What is also confirmed is that there is not one single man of courage in the Republican Congress.

@SenBobCorker
 are you really as dumb as your vote for DeVos? What's it like sucking on the teets of that sow hog named Trump. Pathetic.

Betsy Devos got confirmed. Everyone who voted for her should be ashamed. Party before country. They're using children's education as pawns.

CONFIRMED:
A) Betsy Devos
B) that there is no actual bottom to the pit of "unqualified" before anyone in the GOP grows integrity or balls.

At least we now know how much it costs to become Education Secretary. We got the receipts on the souls of every vote.
