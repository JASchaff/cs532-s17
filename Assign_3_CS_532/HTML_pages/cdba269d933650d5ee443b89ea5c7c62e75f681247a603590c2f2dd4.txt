Lady Gaga
 was flying high during her 
Super Bowl halftime show
, and so is her catalog: the singer has seen a 1,000 percent increase in sales since Sunday’s performance.


Gaga, 30, sold 150,000 digital albums on Sunday, 
Billboard reports
, a drastic increase from the approximate 15,000 units she moved just the day before.


On Sunday, the “Bad Romance” singer also sold more albums and singles than she did the entire week before her acrobatic performance aired, both in digital and physical copies, racking up 30,000 combined sales.


In terms of strictly full-album sales, Gaga’s catalog sold 23,000 downloads, up 1,395 percent — but her singles were responsible for the biggest boost.


Mother Monster moved 960,000 total song downloads on Sunday, with huge increases for each single she performed. Her most recent single, ballad “A Million Reasons,” boasted a 900 percent uptick with 45,000 downloads. “Bad Romance” moved 13,000 digital copies for a 1,525 percent increase and”Born This Way” sold 12,000 for a more than 2,200 percent increase.


“Poker Face” hit its own jackpot with sales of 10,000 copies for a 1,217 percent jump from the previous week.


The bump is 
expected
 to land Gaga’s latest album, “Joanne,” at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, and will likely encourage ticket sales for her upcoming “Joanne” world tour, which she 
announced
 Sunday night.


The sales were likely a result of being the second-most viewed Super Bowl halftime performance ever: 117.5 million viewers tuned in for Gaga’s halftime show, 
Deadline reports
, second only to 
Katy Perry’s
 
2015 performance
, which garnered 120.7 million viewers.
