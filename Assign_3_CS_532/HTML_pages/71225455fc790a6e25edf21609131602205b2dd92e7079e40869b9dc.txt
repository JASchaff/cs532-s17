It took just one video of Lady Gaga 
using a blow-dryer as a wind machine
 in preparation for her halftime Super Bowl performance to have us counting down the hours until we saw the performer's epic stage outfits and make-up.
So, when we watched the singer jump down from the top of the NRG stadium in Houston, Texas wearing a silver leotard, Swarovski crystal-covered boots before shrugging on a golden sparkle jacket with spikes, we can officially say... we lost our sh*t.

However, it was her eye make-up in particular that had us grabbing our eyeshadow palettes and eyeliner pens to recreated the Manhattan-born star's David Bowie/Catwoman-inspired look.
Paired with her teased blonde hair and a rouge lip, Gaga showed off several rows of sparkling crystals in red and white underneath her eyes, fanned out in a butterfly-wing shape to her brow and cheekbone.

According to celebrity makeup artist Sarah Tanno, who designed the look, the star's makeup was inspired by previous performances.

'I took inspiration from all of the iconic looks throughout Gaga's career and just elevated it into something new,' she told 
Teen Vogue
.
To create the look, Tanno revealed she applied a mix of Marc Jacobs products, including the 
Beauty Twinkle Pop Stick Eyeshadow
 in Au Revoir, the 
Beauty Style Eye Con No 7 Plush Palette
, and the 
Highliner Gel Eye Crayon in Violet Femme
.

She then added 
Marc Jacobs Highliner Gel Eye Crayon in Blacquer
 to line Gaga's eyes cat liner before applying mascara.
Later on in the show, the singer then ditched the crystals in favour of a stripped-back makeup look of shimmery-pink eyeshadow and lashes.

Right, that's it ‚Äì we're off to find some sequins. Who's with us?
