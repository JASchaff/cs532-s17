New David Perdue bill would end 22-year-old immigration lottery

U.S. Sen. David Perdue in 2014. John Spink, jspink@ajc.com






WASHINGTON — 
U.S. Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga.,  would abolish a federal green card program originally created to bolster diversity under an immigration plan he plans to unveil later this morning.


The freshman Republican would like to do away with a special lottery system started more than two decades ago that annually selects 50,000 people from countries with traditionally lower immigration rates to permanently live in the United States.

Eliminating the State Department’s Diversity Immigrant Visa Program is just one of several changes to the legal immigration system Perdue, along with fellow first-term Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., plans to propose at a press conference on Capitol Hill later this morning.

Their legislation would also slash the number of visas the government offers refugees to 50,000 per year, on par with what President Donald Trump has advocated for in his recent 
executive order.
 By comparison, Barack Obama announced plans in September to let 110,000 refugees into the country during the 2017 budget year.


Perdue is said to want to target what he describes as “outdated” programs, such as the diversity lottery system, in order to return legal immigration numbers to lower “historic levels” and help reduce competition for American workers’ wages.

“Senator Cotton and I are taking action to fix the shortcomings in our legal immigration system,” Perdue said in a statement. “Returning to our historically normal levels of legal immigration will help improve the quality of American jobs and wages.”

Perdue and Cotton’s bill would also significantly alter another avenue for legal immigration. Under the current system, U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents can sponsor members of their family and get them green cards. The new measure would eliminate preferences for the adult parents, siblings and children of citizens. It would only allow such preferences for spouses and dependent children of migrants, as well as elderly parents in need of caretaking.

Overall, their proposal seeks to lower legal immigration levels by 41 percent compared to 2015 levels during its first year of implementation and by half within a decade.

The legislation comes at a moment when immigration – both legal and illegal – is dominating the national conversation.

Trump administration officials will argue before a federal appeals court today that the president’s divisive 
executive order
, which temporarily bans refugees from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the country, should be restored. Opponents have framed the policy change as unconstitutional.

 



















 

Meanwhile, some of President Donald Trump’s supporters have vowed to boycott several major corporations, including 84 Lumber, Coca-Cola and Budweiser, for airing pro-immigrant Super Bowl ads. And GOP leaders in Congress continue to formalize their strategy for fronting the money for Trump’s proposed wall on the Southern border behind closed doors.

Perdue is not the only Trump ally who has touted curtailing legal immigration. Top White House strategist Steve Bannon and U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., who is expected to be confirmed as attorney general in the days ahead, have similarly advocated for slowing the flow of people entering the country.

The Diversity Immigrant Visa Program is one of the world’s more unique green card programs. Nearly 14.4 million people from scores of countries around the world applied for 50,000 visas in 2015, the last year in which figures are publicly available. That means only 0.3 percent of applicants ultimately “won” the lottery.

Supporters have touted the program for its melting-pot ethos, but critics have faulted it for being susceptible to fraud. They have also called out the program for allowing people from countries that are deemed state sponsors of terror to apply for visas. The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office has a pretty useful analysis of the lottery 
here
.

The program, and more specifically the experience of one Somali refugee, was the subject of a 
memorable episode
 of the public radio program “This American Life” back in 2015 that’s worth a listen.

time for reform


5pts












For several decades, 
immigrants no longer have been limited to bringing
in a spouse and minor children
. Chain Migration categories allow each
immigrant (once a citizen) to petition for adult brothers and sisters, for
adult sons and daughters, and for parents. 


Each
of them can in turn do the same along with bringing their own spouses who can
start whole new chains in their own families, and so forth in a never-ending
pattern.


Sen.
Cotton would stop all of that immigration which adds millions of workers each
decade without any regard to their skills or how they would affect Americans
competing in the same occupations. His bill would limit family immigration to a
spouse and minor children -- including overseas adoptions and marriages by U.S.
citizens.

This bill is an excellent proposal.  This is what the Jordan Commission 
recommended to President Clinton and Congress in 1996.  It should be 
passed immediately.

I saw a report the other day on this and there are several others in both House and Senate supporting. I hadn't thought about the economic impact of immigration before.

Now that I think back, my great-grandfather and grandfather had to prove they could be economically beneficial in order to immigrate back around 1910.

Senators Perdue and Cotton are using government power to intervene in private markets with the intent of conferring an unearned economic advantage to people of a particular nationality.
Has anyone else ever heard of national socialism?
I guess Perdue does have a personal stake in the matter...he needs people staying in their impoverished nations so he has a base of laborers to whom he can outsource "American" jobs.
So, contards, which is it? Is Perdue self-serving in his pursuit of future private profits or is he behaving like a national socialist?  
Perhaps in this case the two motivations align, but that is no excuse for Cotton or any of the other anti-immigration advocates out there.  Your only motivations for opposing immigration are bigotry or laziness.

@
RetiredDude
 It could just as easily be argued that the Government is intervening in private markets to lower labor costs by bringing in so many immigrants.  The fact is that private enterprise does not control who and how many people are allowed to enter this country, the Federal Government does.  The question then becomes does the Federal Government adopt an immigration policy that benefits the bulk of the American citizenry or benefits a few at the top of the economic pyramid at the expense of most other Americans?

Our ancestors came to the USA legally and pledged their support to the USA. They came to build a country and did not have their hand out. Currently, that is not the case. It is come to the USA with a hand out for government funded benefits, drive wages down and have anchor babies.

David Perdue has proven that he is nothing but a shill, following in the stream of the bigger liars and proud ignoramuses, never thinking beyond his own benefit.  He has taken almost $20,000 from the various DeVos political action funds and is thus obviously compromised in judging her qualifications for Secretary of Education but he refuses to either listen to the tsunami of constituent calls opposing her or to recuse himself in the vote.  Instead, he deflects by finding another untapped avenue to attack minority immigrants, one that his Liar In Chief hadn't yet thought of that might win him brownie points from the predators in the White House. 
Corporate donors do not want immigration messed with; taxpayers are tired of competing with people who will do more work for less money and whose social services costs are slipped off corporate balance sheets into taxpayers' pockets.  Politicians have tried to maintain the status quo while pretending to share voters' concerns, and the easiest way to do that is to blame brown immigrants and pretend that the corporations who exploit their labor are blameless.  Perdue is just such a smarmy, lying, amoral suck up.  
If we actually wanted to do something to normalize immigration, we would treat it like tax evasion - employers who hired illegal workers would be hit with punitive fines (shared 50/50 with qualified whistle blowers, just like tax evasion is) and mandatory jail sentences for CEOs.  Make the risk not worth the reward.  Abolish birthright citizenship, which has been purged from just about every other country on earth and is a vestige of the nineteenth century.  And expand the use of temporary work permits, with no provision for bringing in families and legal responsibility for each migrant worker resting with the employer.
The H1N1 visa mills in India and the Phillipines should not be able to flood the system and garner all available visas.  Either shut the system down or limit the number of workers from any single company.  And cut the number issued - Silicon Valley has plenty of American engineers and coders to do the work, but they are not as cheap as immigrants.  Apple, MicroSoft, Google and their colleagues are awash in money and can certainly pay for American labor.

Perdue states he wants to reduce immigration numbers to protect American jobs. However, a better way to ensure Americans get good jobs is to make sure they are qualified for those jobs through education and technical training. Immigrants aren't taking out jobs, rather Americans are under-educated and not qualified for many of the high technical jobs now available. Why not place more emphasis, energy and money into educating our people?

 Check out the movie "Idiocracy".  There are many similarities to what is going on today.  BEWARE!  You may not want your kids watching this movie.  See I even care about stupid liberals' kids.

 I must say you Wacko Liberals have guts.  To make such stupid comments and be so Anti-American and put your picture out there.  Wow!  Anyone who is trying to slow down this Immigration Reform is a complete idiot or Socialist.  Or both.  These people believe that no one died in Tampa or San Bernardino and  all the others.  We are truly living in a world of Idiocracry.
