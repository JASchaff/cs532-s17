For people who supposedly care about the environment, they sure left a lot of trash to be cleaned up.

The Standing Rock Sioux hopes to complete the work before any spring floodwaters from the Cannonball River can wash debris into the Missouri River — the very waterway pipeline opponents are working to protect. 




If it wasn't for double standards, the left would have no standards at all

Except they recognize the issue and are actively working to clean up the site before damage can be done.

They? I don't think the standing rock environmental protection agency or the Dakota sanitation dept were out there protesting, because that's who is cleaning it up.

Check out this article about how much trash they left.  It's insane.

From the article it sounds like the cops are trying to build a criminal case with evidence with no crime reported yet. Disturbing.
'Each load that's dumped is inspected by the Morton County Sheriff's Department.


"We are looking for, as I said, anything illegal, anything that might be used to, I guess, harm our officers during a protest," says Jay Gruebele, Morton County Sheriff's Office Captain.


Authorities are also searching through the piles for evidence they hope they don't find.


"As bad as it sounds, we're looking for people that may have died and could be wrapped up in a canvas or a tarp or tent," says Gruebele.'


Anything that might be used against your officers. If it hasn't been used then there was no crime, right? Is there a missing person report there or do police there always go through people's trash looking for bodies. Total BS.

The article cites a leader of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, who is described in the very first line as "a leader of the tribe that organized the protest." He's the same guy talking about cleaning everything up. Why WOULDN'T tribal leaders in Standing Rock be protesting? It affects them the most.

You miss the point that all this filth was created by outside protesters.

One day you will be mature enough to understand this left right paradigm you love so much is your very own set of slave shackles.


Wake up stupid.  What has the left or right done for you or your fucking family?  So tired of this omg left did it!  Omg the right did it!  No, ALL the stupid asses that fall for party rhetoric like they are on a sports team did.  Doesn't matter if youre stupid with a red or blue flag, youre still stupid for owing allegiance to any political party.

Being rude to someone isnt usually the best way to get them to change their views, or even relate to yours in the slightest. While i agree with you that drawing a line in the sand and putting people on either side of it just creates conflict. Your being a dick and i totally downvoted you for it.

Wondering if maybe they let the protesters have access to garbage pick up services, if this would have been avoidable. If memory recalls, they were not even letting any emergency services near the site. So i really dont think the fault can just be pointed in one direction. The blame isnt unilateral, and it appears both sides are doing there part.

Unless you were forced to leave before you had time to pack and dismantle things properly, and weren't allowed to return to the site to help clean up.


There are lots of folks headed out there to assist with the clean-up efforts, but many of them are worried about getting cited/arrested for their efforts in the process.

Not so simply. world is shades of gray, and anyone that doesn't recognize that is just plain stupid. 


that being said, I do have to agree: maybe garbage pickup services would've helped but this is still abysmally bad on their part. they need to own up that they fucked up.
