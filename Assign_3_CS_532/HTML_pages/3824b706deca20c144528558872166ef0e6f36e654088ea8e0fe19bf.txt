Media covered most of 78 terror attacks Trump said 'not even being reported'

    President Donald Trump claimed the media 'doesn't want to report' on terrorist attacks while delivering remarks at MacDill Air Force Base on Monday.
    
Time
Corrections & Clarifications: An earlier version of this report mis-attributed a quote to the White House press secretary. 
The White House released a list Monday night of 78 terrorist attacks "executed or inspired" by the Islamic State that it claims supports President Trump's assertion that media organizations are deliberately failing to adequately report on terror attacks.
"You’ve seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe it’s happening. It’s gotten to a point where it’s not even being reported," Trump told military leaders and troops during his first visit as president to U.S. Central Command headquarters in Tampa.
"And in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it. They have their reasons and you understand that."
Trump did not explain what he meant by "their reasons." White House press secretary Sean Spicer subsequently clarified Trump's remarks by telling reporters that it wasn't that there was no reporting on terrorist attacks, but that there was insufficient reporting.
Unreported terror attacks? Here are more than 200 articles on USA TODAY covering White House's list
"Protests will get blown out of the water, and yet an attack or a foiled attack doesn’t necessarily get the same coverage."

Widow of Orlando club gunman pleads not guilty
14 dead in San Bernardino, and we still don’t know why one year later
The list of attacks distributed by the White House included high-profile incidents in Paris; Nice, France; Orlando; and San Bernardino, Calif., that received widespread media coverage — including from USA TODAY — as well as more obscure incidents in which police officers and security guards were injured but nobody was killed.
The 78 domestic and international attacks cited took place between September 2014 and December 2016, although there was no explanation as to what merited inclusion on the list. There was no mention, for example, of terrorist attacks in Israel.
The document contains errors. "Attacker" is misspelled more than two dozen times.
During the period in question, USA TODAY reported on the vast majority of the incidents cited on the list. Many of the stories about the major attacks at home and abroad appeared on the front page of USA TODAY print and digital editions.
"The real point here is that these terrorist attacks are so pervasive at this point that they do not spark the wall-to-wall coverage they once did," White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters later said to explain Trump's comments.
"If you look back just a few years ago, any one of these attacks would have been ubiquitous in every news outlet, and now they’re happening so often — at a rate of more than once every two weeks, according to the list we sent around — that networks are not devoting to each of them the same level of coverage they once did."
Mike Jensen, a researcher at the Global Terrorism Database, said there was little-to-no available data about how widely terrorism as a topic has been covered in the news. He said most western media provided blanket coverage of attacks against western targets.
"Even the smaller attacks get mass coverage and can hang around in the news for days, although that is not the case for attacks in, say, Iraq, which disappear pretty quickly."
Pew Research Center has not published research about press coverage of terrorism since 2007, when  it emerged as the topic media gave the most attention to that year.
Last week, Trump's adviser Kellyanne Conway issued a correction to her use of the phrase "Bowling Green massacre," an incident that never happened but which Conway said the news media did not cover. She later said she meant to say "Bowling Green terrorists," a reference to two Iraqi men indicted in 2011 and serving life sentences for using improvised explosive devices against U.S. soldiers in Iraq. The men were living in Bowling Green, Ky., when detained.
Trump has signed an executive order to ban for a 120 days refugees entering the U.S. and a 90-day ban for most citizens of Libya, Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. The order also indefinitely bars Syrians from entering the United States. Trump said his goal was to improve background checks to make sure terrorists are not admitted inadvertently.
A court battle between state and federal lawyers defending and challenging Trump's order was expected to take 
weeks to resolve
