        After a Politico report claimed Trump was bothered by Sean Spicer being portrayed by a woman (Melissa McCarthy), Twitter users suggested O'Donnell for Bannon.
    


If 
Saturday Night Live
 is looking for its Steve Bannon, Rosie O'Donnell wants them to know she's ready and willing.


"Available — if called I will serve," the actress tweeted, along with three exclamation points, in response to a fan who suggested the actress play the controversial chief strategist to President Donald Trump on the NBC sketch series.


"Alec [Baldwin] has Trump. Melissa has Spice. I would need a few days to prepare. So if called — I will be ready," she replied to another.


Last weekend's 
SNL
 featured Melissa McCarthy as Trump press secretary Sean Spicer in a portrayal that has since gone viral. While holding a press conference, McCarthy 
spoofed Spicer
, from his suit to his gum-chewing and reporter antagonizing, punishing "loser" journalists with thrusts from the podium.


Spicer at first said McCarthy could "dial it back" a bit, but admitted the spoof was "cute" while speaking to 
Fox News on Sunday
. A Monday night 
Politico
 report, however, claims Trump took issue with Spicer being portrayed by a woman.


"Trump doesn't like his people to look weak," a source, identified as a top Trump donor, was quoted in the story.




In light of the report, several fans took to Twitter to suggest 
longtime Trump rival
 O'Donnell continue the gender-swapping trend that allegedly irked Trump by having her play Bannon, who is currently portrayed on 
SNL
 only as the Grim Reaper by castmember Mikey Day.


On Tuesday morning, the former 
View
 cohost continued to respond to Twitter followers about the idea. "After Melissa was so brilliant...just a funny idea," she tweeted.


Trump has a long-standing feud with 
SNL
 and has taken to Twitter after many episodes to bash the series and Alec Baldwin's portrayal. The 
Politico
 report identified Trump's unusual silence on Twitter after the McCarthy sketch as a sign of the wary White House reaction to the bit.


"Sources said the caricature of Spicer by McCarthy struck a nerve and was upsetting to the press secretary and to his allies, who immediately saw how damaging it could be in Trump world," the story 
read
.










"It's a funny idea. But 
SNL
 knows what they are doing," O'Donnell told 
NBC News
 on Tuesday, reiterating that if she were asked to play Bannon on the show she would say yes, "of course."


"I have hosted the show in my youth," she said, adding, "Quite an honor. I loved it." 
SNL
 producers declined to comment on the story.


Saturday's episode of SNL opened with 
Grim Reaper-Bannon
, who fed Trump terrible advice from inside the Oval Office. Though Trump did not tweet directly about the episode, he 
appeared to respond
 to the skit's suggestion, as well as recent op-eds claiming Bannon is the one pulling the strings, when he took to Twitter to say that he is the one who calls the shots in his administration. 


"I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!" he tweeted Monday.
