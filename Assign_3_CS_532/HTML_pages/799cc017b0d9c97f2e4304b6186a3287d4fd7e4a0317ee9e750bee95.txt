  WASHINGTON â US President Donald Trump's choice to lead the Labor
  Department has admitted to employing an undocumented immigrant as
  a house cleaner, according to multiple media reports on a
  revelation that has derailed previous Cabinet nominees.


  Andrew Puzder, the CEO of CKE Restaurants Inc., is one of several
  Trump nominees who faced strong opposition from Senate Democrats
  and progressive groups. He has criticized an overtime rule
  championed by the Obama administration and opposed raising the
  minimum wage to $15 an hour.


  An aide for the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and
  Pensions said a week ago that the panel would not "officially"
  schedule a hearing until it received Puzder's paperwork from the
  Office of Government Ethics.


  Some political strategists said that could signal trouble for the
  fast-food executive.


  Several media reports quoted a statement from Puzder late on
  Monday as saying he took action as soon as he learned that his
  housekeeper, whom he and his wife had employed for a few years,
  was not legally permitted to work in the US.










  "We immediately ended her employment and offered her assistance
  in getting legal status," he said in the statement, which was
  cited by The Huffington Post, The New York Times, and other
  media. He said he and his wife paid back taxes for employing the
  maid to the US Internal Revenue Service and to the state of
  California.


  Previous presidential appointees have run into problems over
  immigration issues.


  Linda Chavez, nominated for labor secretary by President George
  W. Bush in 2001, allowed a Guatemalan woman who was in the US
  illegally to live in her home and gave her spending money.


  Zoe Baird, President Bill Clinton's nominee for attorney general
  in 1993, withdrew from consideration after she admitted hiring
  two immigrants living in the US illegally as a driver and a nanny
  and not paying their Social Security taxes.


  Another Bush nominee, former New York City police commissioner
  Bernard Kerik, withdrew his name from consideration for secretary
  of homeland security in 2004 after he disclosed that questions
  had been raised about the legal status of a former housekeeper
  and nanny.
