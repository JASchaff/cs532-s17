Now that she‚Äôs 
conquered the Super Bowl
, 
Lady Gaga
 is moving on to an entirely different competition.


The pop singer will serve as guest-judge on the Season 9 premiere of ‚ÄúRuPaul‚Äôs Drag Race,‚Äù Logo announced Tuesday in a statement. The appearance, airing in March, will mark Gaga‚Äôs¬†‚ÄúDrag Race‚Äù debut ‚Äî and it‚Äôs actually kind of amazing that she‚Äôs never been on the show before, right?


Gaga confirmed the news with a tweet that includes a sneak peek at her guest spot.


In the video, RuPaul tells everyone, ‚ÄúGentlemen, start your engines,‚Äù before¬†Lady Gaga appears ‚Äî looking fabulous in a sequined bodysuit and dramatic eye makeup ‚Äî to kick off the competition: ‚ÄúMay the best woman win.‚Äù Her arrival seems to set off a frenzy of emotions among the competing queens, with screams of delight and tears flowing. (One of them may have even fainted?)


In addition to her recent Super Bowl halftime gig, Lady Gaga has graced the small screen with her presence in the last two seasons of FX‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerican Horror Story,‚Äù picking up a Golden Globe last year for her work on ‚ÄúAHS: Hotel.‚Äù
