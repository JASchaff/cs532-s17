Submit a Comment on the Dakota Access Pipeline






Donald Trump and Big Oil are trying to exempt the Dakota Access pipeline from a full environmental review.


On his second day in office Trump wrote a memo declaring that the Dakota Access Pipeline is in the national interest, and that the Army Corps should consider scrapping environmental review in order to approve it. Then yesterday, the Acting Secretary of the Army directed the Army Corps to comply with Trump's memo. This permit could be granted any day now, and construction could resume. 
Now is not the time to back down.


Thanks to the courageous opposition of Indigenous communities, the project was halted for a full review last fall. Every comment submitted in support of the review builds the legal case against Trump's reckless attempt to fast-track the pipeline.


The deadline for review is February 20th. Submit your comment now and stand up to Trump's pipeline plan.


The 1,168-mile Dakota Access Pipeline, if completed, would carry 450,000 barrels of fracked oil every day through four states, cutting through communities, farms, sensitive natural areas, wildlife habitat, and tribal lands like the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's ancestral lands. It would also cross under the Missouri River just upstream of the Tribe's drinking water supply, where a spill would mean a serious threat to the Tribe's health, culture, and way of life.


It should not be approved, and defending the Environmental Impact Statement is the next crucial step in that direction.

The Army Corp’s review of the Dakota Access fracked oil pipeline must evaluate:

- The full scope of the climate impact of the production and consumption of the pipeline's fracked oil.

- The impacts of oil spills along the entire route -- including every waterway and drinking water supply. 

- The cultural impacts of the pipeline, including the effects on Tribal lands, burial grounds, and archaeological sites. 

The Corps must consult with the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and evaluate how this pipeline would affect their drinking water, health, culture, and way of life, and include environmental justice as part of their evaluation to ensure that low-income communities of color aren't left to bear the greatest risk of the project.
