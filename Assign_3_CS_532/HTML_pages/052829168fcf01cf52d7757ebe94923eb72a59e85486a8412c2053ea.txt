If there is a better time to announce a world tour than right after performing halftime at the Super Bowl, we haven’t found it.
Following a spirited, drone-filled halftime show Lady Gaga announced she would entertain the world on the Joanne World Tour—a festive display of what we can only presume will be gaudy costumes and delicious pop renditions.
The fun kicks off in North America on August 1 in Vancouver before it heads out to Europe with a Barcelona show on September 22. You will have to wait just a bit to snag tickets. For those hoping to see the Grammy winner in person in Barcelona, Paris, Zurich, Hamburg, Berlin and Koln, tickets go on sale February 10.
The rest of Europe, as well as those cities on the first leg of the tour, can get in on the action on Feb. 13, while the second leg of North America becoming available on Feb. 20.

Citi cardmembers get a bit of a head start on the sale, and further details on that can be found at 
citiprivatepass.com
.
You are probably wondering when Lady Gaga will come to your town. Well, you can get a full list as well as ticket information at 
her official website
 or at 
Live Nation
.
After Vancouver, the Golden Globe winner will then head off to Edmonton, Tacoma and Los Angeles before performing in Las Vegas in August. As we mentioned, she will start a European leg on September 22, shortly after concluding this hemisphere with a Sept. 15 concert in Rio de Janeiro.
Lady Gaga will play 31 cities before a return effort in the states, kicking off on November 5 in Indianapolis.
So far, there is no word on whether those delightful drones will also make the trip.
