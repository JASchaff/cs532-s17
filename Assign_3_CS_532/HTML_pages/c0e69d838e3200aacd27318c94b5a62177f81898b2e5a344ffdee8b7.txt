Forget the 
flying selfie stick
. Producers from the Lifetime TV show 
Unreal
 came to viral marketing company Thinkmodo with a challenge: Create a cool, interesting way to promote the show&apos;s new season, which starts airing on June 6. And boy, did they deliver. 
Thinkmodo came up with the world&apos;s 
first automated selfie stick
, complete with fans for wind-swept hair and beauty lights to make your face look flawless. The stick also automatically retracts and extends. And while there are only two of these in the world, yes, they really work (although apparently they&apos;re 
super heavy
).
Don&apos;t hold your breath for these telescopic selfie sticks to be 
available for purchase
 any time soon, but here&apos;s to hoping they inspire someone to create and sell a consumer version. Who wouldn&apos;t want to get the supermodel treatment every time they take a selfie?
