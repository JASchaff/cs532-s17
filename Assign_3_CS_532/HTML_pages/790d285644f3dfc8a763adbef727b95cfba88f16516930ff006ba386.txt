Metallica
 will play this year’s 
Grammy Awards
 show with 
Lady Gaga
, three years after their 
surprise turn
 on the same show with a classical pianist. Gaga announced the collaboration on 
Twitter
 just days after a celebrated 
halftime performance
 at Super Bowl 51.

February 7, 2017




As strange as her pairing with Metallica seems, Lady Gaga has plenty of rock connections. Originally known by her given name of Stefani Germanotta, the singer-songwriter has been covering 
Led Zeppelin
 at least as far back as 2006, when she 
belted out “D’yer Mak’er”
 at the Bitter End.


Last year, Lady Gaga offered an impromptu – and quite impressive – 
a cappella rendition
 of “Black Dog” on 
The Howard Stern Show
. 
Iron Maiden
‘s 
Bruce Dickinson
 has praised Lady Gaga in the past, noting her “
great sense of drama
.” 
Gene Simmons
 and 
Anthrax
‘s 
Scott Ian
 are also 
fans
.


The 59th annual Grammy Awards ceremony airs Sunday on CBS. 
Paul McCartney
, 
Bob Dylan
 and 
David Bowie
 earned 
multiple nominations
 this year. Metallica shared the stage with classical pianist Lang Lang during the 56th annual show in 2014, performing “One” from 1988’s 
… And Justice for All
.
