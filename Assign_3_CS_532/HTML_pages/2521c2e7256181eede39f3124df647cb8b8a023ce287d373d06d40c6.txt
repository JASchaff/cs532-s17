In a recent 
Medium post
, Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) argued, “Democrats desperately are searching for a valid reason to oppose Betsy DeVos for U.S. Education Secretary.” 






With all due respect to Alexander, it’s not all that difficult to find reasons to oppose DeVos’ nomination. As the most inexperienced and untested nominee for secretary of education in U.S. history, DeVos threatens to upend America’s public education system with plans that are worrisome at best and insidiously destructive at worst. 






Sen. Alexander, for your reference, here are five extremely valid reasons why so many oppose Betsy DeVos’ nomination:






1.
 
Lack of experience.
 DeVos has never 
attended, worked in nor sent her children
 to public schools. She has no government experience and no experience running or managing a bureaucracy or large organization. Instead, DeVos has spent much of her adulthood donating millions to politicians so that she can in turn lobby them to support her favorite pet cause: vouchers that give money to 
conservative religious schools
 with zero strings attached. 






To those who argue that maybe an outsider’s perspective is what is needed in Washington, that only works when we are talking about a proven leader who has a track record of effectiveness –such as a military general with strategic prowess, a transformational CEO or a superintendent who successfully improved a major school system. DeVos fails to meet these criteria.

5 Questions for Betsy DeVos




These questions need answers before Trump's nominee for education secretary is confirmed.












2. Lack of knowledge and preparation.
 DeVos failed to prepare for her own confirmation hearing with even a baseline level of adequacy. 
News outlets
 gave DeVos’ 
confirmation hearing
 
performance
 a 
failing grade
. The Los Angeles Times editorial board went so far as to say that she’d 
embarrassed herself
. 


















To accommodate for her lack of understanding of basic education policy issues, Republicans threw DeVos softball questions during her hearing, such as, “Do you support public education?” from Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. Yet even despite the softball questions, there is a very 
strong possibility that she perjured herself
 by downplaying her 
role in her parents’ foundation
. DeVos also revealed that she 
didn’t understand a basic tenet of one of the most important education laws
, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. 






3.
 
Well outside the mainstream.
 DeVos has said that she wants to “
advance God’s kingdom
” through school reform, a view that is far from mainstream. Similarly, many of her family members’ views – which she has, whether genuinely or shrewdly sought to distance herself from recently – are alarmingly extreme, such as support for 
conversion therapy
, 
opposition to same-sex marriage
 or the view that 
intelligent design should be taught
 in schools.

Devos' Ignorance Is a Danger to Students With Disabilities




Students with disabilities deserve a secretary of education who will protect their civil rights.












4.
 
A dangerous precedent for pay-for-play in politics.
 During DeVos’s hearing, Sen. Bernie Sanders asked DeVos, “Do you think that if you were not a multibillionaire, if your family had not made hundreds of millions of dollars in contributions, that you would be sitting here today?” The implication that DeVos is only being considered for this job, which would be her first as a public servant, as a political favor to reward her for years of donations is not without merit. While Sen. Alexander asserted in his post that her critics dislike her because she’s wealthy, in reality it’s because her wealth appears to be buying her a cabinet post that she is unqualified to hold. 






By some estimates, DeVos and her family have donated over 
$200 million
 to Republicans nationally, including 
sizable donations to many of the senators who will vote on her confirmation
. In fact, DeVos is open about her support of pay-for-play, once 
stating
 that “I have decided to stop taking offense at the suggestion that we are buying influence. Now I simply concede the point. They are right. We do expect something in return.”


















5.
 
No plans or vision, except for outdated and ineffective policies that are harmful to public education.
 What is DeVos’ vision for how to improve public education? Despite a hearing and several weeks of scrutiny, no one knows. She dodged basic questions at the hearing, to the point of ridicule. At one point in response to questioning by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, DeVos 
simply
 repeated her stock phrase, “I support accountability,” yet refused to discuss even the most basic of related policy details.

Ask DeVos About Title I Funding




How Trump's education secretary pick answers will determine her approach to the job ahead.












What we do know about DeVos is that she wants to 
divert money now spent on public education – 
which is guaranteed for all students – to private schools that can turn students away or kick them out because of their gender identity or sexual orientation, a disability that is an inconvenience to school personnel, any behavior they deem problematic or essentially any other reason of their choosing. Given that a significant chunk of the country has no access to private school options, this plan will also mean significantly fewer education dollars overall in many areas, often in districts that simply cannot afford to lose funding. Even most voucher advocates have now 
moved away from the model
 that DeVos continues to espouse for these and other reasons. 






It is not partisan, unfair or “desperate” to oppose DeVos’ nomination. Rather, it is born out of a real fear that putting DeVos in charge of the nation’s public schools could inflict severe harm on our nation’s most vulnerable students.
