Published on Jan 12, 2017
Tired Earth is an international group trying to improve awareness, get motivated hearts together, and increase the hope for a shiny future. We are residents of a kind and caring planet called Earth; a planet with a lot of water and soil, with a lot of creatures, some too tiny to see, some too big to ignore. To make a better life, mankind has made a lot of efforts; however, these efforts has had many side effects that mankind was not aware of. We have polluted water and soil, ruined forests, made changes to the climate, killed or caused death to many species of animals. Thus, the planet Earth is really tired now.
