The Most Anticipated New Winter Shows




























Ever wondered what it would look like to see two metric tons of wigs, fake eyelashes, sequins and fake nails explode at the same time? 
Well, you may not have to wonder longer because 
Lady Gaga
 is set to appear on the premiere of 
RuPaul's Drag Race
 when it returns for Season 9, and when the contestants see her, they're likely to combust with excitement.
Fresh from her
 well-received Super Bowl performance
, Gaga is on a roll -- and perhaps back to the over-the-top self we knew of her before she got all classy. She'll perform with Metallica at the Grammys Sunday, and, it was announced Tuesday, the 
American Horror Story
 
actress will appear on 
Drag Race 
soon too.
RuPaul's Drag Race
: The All-Stars look back on their most Gif-able moments
That Gaga will appear on Logo's Emmy-winning institution of creativity, insane performances and severe shade shouldn't be a surprise: Gaga is of course a huge LGBT icon, her persona built in large part around wild costumes and changing identities. 




And the show has hosted many an A-list celebrity in its day -- from 
Vanessa Williams 
to 
Neil Patrick Harris
 and more. Hardly any previous guests, though, have had the star power and gay street cred as Gaga, who'll no doubt drive the contestants crazy when they catch a glimpse of her in the work room. From the looks of the clip Logo released Tuesday, there's gonna be some falling and out and fainting.
RuPaul's Drag Race
 announced its
 13 Season 9 contestants
 last week. It has yet to announce a premiere date.
