Silicon Valley's immigrant tech workers are scared of buying homes after Trump's travel ban

  A pair of married software engineers hooked up with real estate
  agent Tim Gullicksen about six months ago in pursuit of their
  dream home.




  After taking time to peruse the market, the couple found a
  multimillion-dollar single-family home in San Francisco that they
  loved. In January, they wrote an offer letter to the seller,
  complete with an attached photo of the young family, and squared
  away their finances.




  In early February, the couple told Gullicksen they would no
  longer place a bid. They planned to take a three-week vacation in
  their native country of India, and decided they couldn't risk
  buying a house if President Donald Trump's administration
  wouldn't let them back into the US. (While no such restriction
  exists, they worry the new administration might change its mind.)
  They declined to speak with Business Insider directly for fear of
  retribution from the government.



San Francisco is one of the most competitive housing
  markets in the US, with a median listing price that tops $1.1
  million. But
 foreign-born tech workers, who often commute
  to Silicon Valley, are starting to back out of buying property
  because they worry about an escalating crackdown on immigration
  under Trump, according to some real estate agents.

  More than 100,000 visas
 have been revoked since an executive
  order issued on January 27 temporarily banned citizens of seven
  majority-Muslim countries from entering the US. 
Real estate
  agents in the Bay Area tell Business Insider they started to hear
  rumblings among prospective buyers in late January, after Trump
  signed off on the immigration ban. The topic came up in company
  meetings, private emails, and closed groups for realtors on
  Facebook.






Nina Hatvany, a luxury realtor with Pacific Union
  International, 

  sold more houses
 in terms of sales volume â $216 million â
  than any other agent in San Francisco last year. Hatvany tells
  Business Insider she frequently takes on clients who originated
  outside the US.






"I often have conversations, 'Is this a good place to put
  my money?' Absent earthquakes, it is," Hatvany says. "[The San
  Francisco Bay Area] has certainly shown tremendous appreciation,
  and it's a wonderful place to live. ...


If people
  start to worry about whether they're going to be able to get into
  the country when they come home from vacation, that could
  change."





  Dylan Hunter, a real estate agent with Pacific Union
  International, said he hasn't had a client "pull the red cord"
  yet, but he knows immigration reform is a concern for some. He's
  working with a couple based in San Francisco â one is an
  investment banker, the other works at Google â who are in the
  market for a $2 million single-family home. Their relatives in
  India are worried the couple will never be able to visit, and
  vice versa.




  Google's CEO 
Sundar Pichai 

  issued a company-wide memo last month
 urging staff traveling
  overseas to return immediately. He said 
100 employees are
  affected by the executive order.





  One ripple effect of the Trump administration's policies might be
  a downturn in the Bay Area's housing market. Karen Yang, a real
  estate agent with Fling Yang & Associates, says that if H-1B
  visa holders (a type of visa that allows US companies to bring in
  foreign professionals with specialized skills) disappear from the
  marketplace, a sudden lack of competition could drive down the
  price of a single-family home in the city.




  Most real estate agents we spoke with, however, said their
  clients should not be directly impacted by the travel ban (at
  least for now).





Jackie Cuneo, a senior loan officer at mortgage lender
  Summit Funding, tells Business Insider that so long as H-1B visa
  holders have a Social Security number, a US address, more than
  one year left on their visa, and a financial footprint
  established in the US, they're treated like citizens.






It's unclear how 

  Trump's travel ban
 could affect these standards, and if the
  rules vary for H-1B carriers who originated from one of the seven
  countries named in the executive order.Â 


It also
  appears Trump will go after the H-1B visa directly in an attempt
  to open up more jobs for American workers, according to
  aÂ 
leaked
  draft of a new executive order
.





  In the hypothetical situation that an immigrant worker gets their
  H-1B visa revoked shortly after buying a house, they would have
  to pay between 6% and 7% of the home value in closing costs and
  transfer tax, a one-time fee imposed on the owner when a property
  changes hands.

  Trump's immigration ban sent shockwaves throughout the Bay Area,
  where technology companies rely on an international talent pool.
  At Facebook, 

  more than 15%
 of US employees in 2016 worked for the social
  giant under a temporary work visa.





Gullicksen, the real estate agent whose clients backpedaled
  because they have a vacation coming up, said the "What if?"
  question is ultimately what cost him the sale.





  "We were just about to submit an offer that was due ... today,
  actually," Gullicksen said. "
A couple days ago, they said,
  'We loved that house but we're really nervous about spending that
  much money and maybe not staying here."'





  On February 5th, 97 tech firms, including Google, Apple, and
  Facebook, 

  filed a legal brief opposing the travel ban
, 
in

  Silicon Valley's first united front attack on the new
  administration. The brief argues 
that the policy "inflicts
  significant harm on American business."






Real estate agents will be keeping a close eye on what
  happens next.
