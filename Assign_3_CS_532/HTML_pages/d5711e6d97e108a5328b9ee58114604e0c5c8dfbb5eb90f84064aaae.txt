Sean Spicer Responded To SNL's Impression Of Him






Rosie O’Donnell Says ‘Of Course’ She’d Play Steve Bannon On ‘SNL’

The role of President Trump’s puppet-master Steve Bannon on 
SNL
 is currently played by Mikey Day in a Grim Reaper outfit. This is not ideal for two reasons: 1) that costume must smell terrible, and 2) there’s only so much you can do with Death personified. He’s not nearly as talkative as Will Ferrell’s 
song-writing Lucifer
. But 
SNL
 may have found a temporary solution.


Following Melissa McCarthy’s 
incredible impression
 of Sean Spicer during Saturday’s K-Stew-hosted episode, which in turn made the White House Press Secretary 
incredibly angry
, Rosie O’Donnell volunteered as tribute to play Bannon. “i am here to serve,” she tweeted. “alec has trump – melissa has spice – i would need a few days to prepare – so if called – i will be ready.”

The 
A League of Their Own
 star (if you were in 
A League of Their Own
, you will always be referred to as “
A League of Their Own
 star,” even Tom Hanks) 
confirmed with NBC News
 that “if asked, of course I would. Alec is amazing, Melissa McCarthy was perfect. It’s a funny idea. But 
SNL
 knows what they are doing. I have hosted the show in my youth. Quite an honor. I loved it.”


It’s possible the cast might be wary of Lorne Michaels’ fondness for bringing in outside talent to play major politicians — from Larry David’s Bernie Sanders to Alec Baldwin’s Trump to McCarthy’s Spicer — and it’s not as if O’Donnell is going to be available every week. And yet, this needs to happen, if only because of how much it will 
“deeply disturb” Trump
. At least give Rosie one shot.
