Submit Your Comment: Say NO to the Dakota Access Pipeline 




The U.S. Army Corps just announced that it will allow construction on the Dakota Access Pipeline to continue. 
If completed, this pipeline would threaten indigenous land and drinking water for millions of people, and exacerbate climate change.
We will be hand-delivering comments to the Army Corps of Engineers, in protest of their decision. Please submit yours right now!
Please edit your message below.
 It makes a far bigger impact if you customize your message and tell the Army Corps why YOU oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline.

I urge you to conduct a thorough and comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Dakota Access Pipeline. You must take into consideration the terrible record of spills that have been prevalent throughout this country and the poor oversight that a self-regulated industry enjoys.  

The EIS must measure the inevitable impact on climate change that this pipeline poses and include a strict analysis of the potential impacts to Lake Oahe and to the way of life of the Standing Rock Sioux.
 
There have been four serious spills not far from the Standing Rock camps, with a total estimated spill volume of 2,073,000 gallons of petroleum and hazardous waste. The petroleum industry has the highest financial profitability of any other industry in the U.S. and suffers an AVERAGE of one significant pipeline failure a day.
 






A responsible and conscientious analysis WILL reveal that pipeline technology cannot safeguard our climate, our drinking water and our indigenous friends' way of life.


Sincerely,
[Your Name]
