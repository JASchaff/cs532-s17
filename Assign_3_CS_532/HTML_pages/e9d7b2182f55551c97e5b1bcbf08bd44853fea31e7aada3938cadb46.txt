Twitter Reacts to Jill Stein’s Nonsensical Tweet Blaming Democrats for DeVos Confirmation

For those paying attention to the news today, you probably noticed that President 
Donald Trump’s
 Secretary of Education nominee, 
Betsy DeVos
, 
was confirmed by the Senate today
. The final vote was 51-50 as Vice President Mike Pence had to cast a historical tie-breaking vote due to the fact that all 48 Senators in the Democratic Caucus, along with two Republicans, voted against the confirmation.


The vote today followed a 24-hour hold of the Senate floor by Democrats in which they hoped they’d be able to convince at least one more Republican to switch sides and go against DeVos, knowing that a tie would mean Pence would have to step in.


Well, earlier today, Green Party Presidential candidate 
Jill Stein
 took to Twitter to blame DeVos’s successful appointment on…Democrats?!?




Why would we have a tie on such an egregious nominee? Because Democrats serve corporate interests.

As you would imagine, Twitter noticed this and took action:




Every single Democrat voted against Betsy DeVos, but Jill Stein does make an excellent argument that our schools have failed our children.

Jill Stein is the Bill Maher of electoral politics.

I don’t think Jill Stein has been paying attention. Every single Democrat opposed DeVos. Plus two GOPers.

And the Trump War Room Director for the DNC weighed in, highlighting that Stein once shared a dinner table with Russian President 
Vladimir Putin
.




Hey woman who coincidentally was at a dinner with Vladimir Putin and Michael Flynn —


All Democrats voted against DeVos.
