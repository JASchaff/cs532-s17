The president’s January executive order that banned travelers from seven countries from entering the United States has affected Brooklyn in myriad ways, tearing apart families, causing 
massive protests
, and putting immigrant communities here on edge.


Now, the Brooklyn Museum and Brooklyn Community Foundation are holding a panel to get in-depth perspective on the issue from the leaders of groups who work for immigrant interests every day.

Defending Immigrant Rights: A Brooklyn Call to Action will discuss the effects of President Trump’s executive order on Brooklyn’s immigrant communities. Leaders of community organizations that are part of the Immigrant Rights Fund, which is funded by the Brooklyn Community Foundation, will speak. 


Panelists include activist and Brooklynite Linda Sarsour, the executive director of the Arab American Association of New York, who 
has said she would like to be
 mayor of an independent Brooklyn.
