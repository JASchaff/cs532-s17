Misspelling Plagues Budweiser Boycott And People Are Trolling It Hard

Further fallout from this past Sunday's Super Bowl is playing out on the internet today, and this particular case has to do with a Budweiser commercial.

The commercial that debuted during the Super Bowl was a dramatic and cinematic retelling of the German-to-American immigration of Adolphus Busch, the later co-founder of America's beer.
The commercial ended with a powerful message: When nothing stops your dream. This is the beer we drink.
An inspiring message about working hard? A resounding call for a refreshing brewski because you refuse to give up on your goals and wishes?
Many conservatives didn't think so. In fact, they viewed it as a slap in the face of Trump supporters, and a sneaky supporting view of immigration.

And so began a strongly voiced boycott of America's beer. Conservatives across the internet adopted a simple hashtag and began to voice their grievances with the beer company that was attacking their true American values.

There was only one tiny problem with the Budweiser boycott: when it finally began to trend on Twitter, it became obvious to onlookers that the folks calling for the boycott did not actually know how to correctly spell the beer they so despised.
