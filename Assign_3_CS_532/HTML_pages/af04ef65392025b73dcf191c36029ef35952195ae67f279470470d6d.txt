The nation's favourite architect has transformed plenty of homes across the country but some projects are more memorable than others.






Speaking to RTE Player, Dermot recalled some of his favourite moments from the past nine seasons.


A particular highlight was the redesign of a 1970's semi-detached house in Malahide to suit the needs to wheelchair-bound Michael (12), who was only delighted with the finished results.
















Dermot also recalled the time he discovered a "monster" living in the walls of an 1850's coach house in Maynooth. The "monster" turned out to be fungus but it was still a bit of a stomach-churning challenge for the team. But by the time they had finished renovating the house, the fungus was a distant memory. 
Just look at that pristine kitchen.









 
Do you remember the Harolds who had moved 17 times in the last 22 years? Dermot certainly does. The couple wanted to add a gym, a "rake of bedrooms" and a library to their 1950's bungalow in Nenagh. A Feng Shui expert was introduced at the end which only made matters worse as Dermot, naturally, wasn't convinced it would help matters.






And then there was long-haul pilot Ian, who was totally unconvinced about Dermot's vision to build a massive concrete feature wall in an attempt to put a contemporary stamp on his 1930's home in Drogehda.










Room to Improve is on RTE One, Sundays at 9.35pm.
