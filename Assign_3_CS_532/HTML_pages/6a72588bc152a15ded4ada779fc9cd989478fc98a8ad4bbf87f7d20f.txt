Trump's pick for labor secretary admits to employing illegal immigrant

President Donald Trump's choice to lead the Labor Department has admitted to employing an undocumented immigrant as a house cleaner, according to multiple media reports on a revelation that has derailed previous Cabinet nominees.
Andrew Pudzer, chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants Inc, is one of several Trump nominees who faced strong opposition from Senate Democrats and progressive groups. He has criticized an overtime rule championed by the Obama administration and opposed raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
An aide for the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions said a week ago that the panel would not "officially" schedule a hearing until it receives Pudzer's paperwork from the Office of Government Ethics.
Some political strategists said that could signal trouble for the fast-food executive.
Several media reports quoted a statement from Pudzer late on Monday as saying he took action as soon as he learned that his housekeeper, whom he and his wife had employed for a few years, was not legally permitted to work in the United States.
"We immediately ended her employment and offered her assistance in getting legal status," he said in the statement, which was cited by the Huffington Post, the New York Times and other media. He said he and his wife paid back taxes for employing the maid to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and to the state of California.
Previous presidential appointees have run into problems over immigration issues.
Linda Chavez, nominated for labor secretary by President George W. Bush in 2001, allowed a Guatemalan woman who was in the United States illegally to live in her home and gave her spending money.
Zoe Baird, President Bill Clinton's nominee for attorney general in 1993, withdrew from consideration after she admitted hiring two illegal immigrants as a driver and a nanny and not paying their Social Security taxes.
Another Bush nominee, former New York City police commissioner Bernard Kerik, withdrew his name from consideration for homeland security secretary in 2004 after he disclosed that questions had been raised about the legal status of a former housekeeper and nanny.

Samantha Barks on 'Bitter Harvest' and not only doing misery
Samantha Barks doesn’t always have it rough. The English actress is best known for playing heartbroken Eponine in “Les Miserables,” first on stage in London and then in the 2012 movie. And in her new film, “Bitter Harvest,” she takes the role of Natalka, a young woman in Soviet Ukraine who struggles to survive through the “Holodomor,” when Stalin instituted a man-made famine that led to the deaths of 2 ½ to 7 ½ million. It’s a grim movie, though Barks, 26, has been segueing to lighter fare: She...

This is what Kim Kardashian says about sex tape rumors
For some reason, there’s a rumor that Kim Kardashian has filmed a new sex tape. According to Daily Mail, rumors of an “explicit video” starring the 36-year-old reality star were reported by Britain’s Mirror newspaper. Apparently the leaked footage is mostly just Kardashian sitting on a bed in some — probably unnecessarily elaborate — lingerie. Related: Kim & Kanye are releasing a children's clothing line But her rep told Daily Mail, it’s not true: “It’s the same old tape.” If you somehow don’t...

Supreme branded Metrocards are still causing a frenzy
Our first question upon hearing about the Supreme-MTA collab, which launched Monday: Why would you buy a Supreme-branded Metrocard? Riding the subway is already prohibitively expensive, and yet enough hypebeasts ponied up the $5.50/card so they could swipe in style that it caused a frenzy that's still going strong. Here's the latest, per the NYCT Subway Twitter account:    










It sounds like Gwen Stefani’s kids can’t recognize her without makeup
You have to give it to Gwen Stefani: throughout her long career, she has definitely established a signature look. Very blonde hair, very red lips, and occasionally a touch of cultural appropriation. So glam! Chatting with InStyle, the Revlon ambassador reveals what, exactly, makeup means to her. “[Makeup] says a lot, I think. Even my kids are so used to me wearing makeup that if I don’t, they’ll be like, “Wait are you gonna put on makeup?’ I’m like, ‘Of course I’m going to.’ It’s just who I...










Geek Girl in Hollywood: Let's all binge-watch 'Supernatural'
I’ve been binge-watching “Supernatural” for a project. I used to watch it live, years ago, but sort of fell off of the “Supernatural” train. It’s been lovely to rediscover what I’d missed out on. Though I’m not able to get to this weekend's “Supernatural” convention, at the very least I wanted to write about the show that lately has made my evenings a blast. I know I’ve talked before about the joy of binge-watching old shows you used to love. Having “Friends” on in the background is soothing. I...

Neighborhood guide: Somerville's squares
You’ve heard the comparisons before, and they’re only becoming more frequent. “[Somerville] is the Williamsburg, Brooklyn, of Massachusetts,” says O’Necia Simpson, Realtor at Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in Cambridge. “There is a tremendous influx of millennial foodies, the young, educated tech guru and the hipster starter family all throughout Somerville.” But don’t for a second think it’s just the skinny jeans and organic coffee that’ll make you think of Brooklyn. Just like the New...










Crunch Time: Josh Pastner vs. Syracuse fan, Bill Belichick on a boat
So this Syracuse fan called the head coach of the Georgia Tech basketball team, Josh Pastner, and complained that Tech fans were being too mean by chanting “air ball” at one of Syracuse’s players every time he touched the ball in a recent game. Yes, the “air ball” chant – sports’ most innocuous jeer that would not even offend your Great Aunt Gertrude. The only good part about this story is that Pastner actually called this guy back and defended the Georgia Tech fans. “I told him this is men’s...

Last days of brunch at the Waldorf Astoria
Today 12:48 pm 
When the Waldorf Astoria closes at the end of this month to be converted into luxury condos, New York will lose one of its most lavish experiences: brunch at Peacock Alley. On Sundays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., the historic hotel’s lobby restaurant spills out beyond its usual gold-gilded confines to set a buffet worthy of the only hotel good enough for the king of Zamunda. There are no kale frittatas or acai bowls here — just as the Waldorf defied the stock market crash to open in 1931 as the...

Carjack victim arrested for allegedly exaggerating story to make police respond faster
Today 12:07 pm 
A pizza deliveryman was carjacked at gunpoint but thought he needed to add something more to the story to get Philadelphia police to investigate, authorities said. So he created a 4-year-old nephew who was in the backseat of the car at the time two men made off with the vehicle, according to authorities. Now, 22-year-old Marcus Fletcher is facing misdemeanor charges for allegedly filing a false report after a police search ended with the discovery of his stolen car with no child inside....

It's all fun and games in Boston's social sports leagues
Yesterday  6:37 pm 
As a hockey game finished up at Reilly Memorial Rink in Brighton Monday night, 40 sneaker-clad co-eds in brightly colored shirts took over the ice. They looked ready for a scrimmage. The name of the game? Broomball. It’s one of nearly two dozen sports offered to adults by a handful of sports leagues around Boston. Looking for a little competition? Check out the hockey, basketball or softball leagues. Broomball tends to be a little more laid back. The fast moving, 40-minute games consist of a...
