                                The #PostcardsToBannon movement encourages people to write to President Trump's chief strategist instead

Writing a letter to the president is almost as ubiquitous as writing a letter to Santa. When President Obama took office, he relished the opportunity to read his mail, pledging to read 
10 letters a day
. President Trump will be lucky if he receives 10 letters on Wednesday at this rate, because critics of the president have found an unorthodox way to express their disapproval through the postal service.
With the hashtag #PostcardstoBannon, Twitter users have been sharing the postcards and letters they plan on mailing to the White House.
My contribution to the 
#PostcardsToBannon
 campaign is on its way. Get a postcard, address it to 
#PresidentBannon
, tell him what you think!

Participants have embraced the tactic for two reasons: It focuses attention on the White House chief strategist, who 
prefers to avoid
 the limelight and the scrutiny that comes with it; and it needles President Trump, who apparently does not appreciate the nickname his opponents have given his chief strategist.
On Monday, Trump took to Twitter to correct any misconceived notions about the hierarchy of the Oval Office.
“I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it,” the 
tweet said
. “Some fake news media, in order to marginalize, lies!”
If only someone would write a letter to President Trump that accumulated all of the data on fatal domestic terrorist attacks that came at the hands of immigrants and refugees from the countries he banned, then he would learn that 
the total is zero
. Steve Bannon is said to be 
the architect
 of the executive order that targeted seven predominantly-Muslim countries.
