Silicon Valley firms could start protecting immigrant employees by moving them to Canada

  If the talent can't stay in the US, Silicon Valley has a backup
  option: Create a safe haven up north.


  On January 30, White House press secretary Sean Spicer 

  confirmed
 that administration officials had drafted an
  executive order to transform how foreign-born workers find US
  jobs. The order, whose details have yet to be released, would be
  a transformation of the H-1B work-visa program.


  H-1B visas allow roughly 85,000 highly skilled immigrant workers
  to takeÂ jobs in the US each year. Many companies rely on the
  program to recruit stronger talent than they can find within
  America's borders. And any changes meant to favor American-born
  workers could mean less access to that talent in the future.


  A day after Spicer's announcement, a band of entrepreneurs came
  out with news of their own: They had formed 
True North
, a company based
  out of Vancouver that allows American businesses to move
  immigrant workers to Canada.


  For $6,000, a company can pay True North to fly the employee to
  Vancouver, house them for two nights, and have them meet with an
  immigration expert to sort out gaining residency.










  True North says its program is designed both for people looking
  to leave the US and those who have fears about not being allowed
  back in. Founders Michael Tippett, Scott Rafer, Christian
  Gammill, and Kirsten Spoljaric created the company just a few
  days after President Donald Trump banned immigrants from seven
  predominantly Muslim countries.


  Immigration lawyer Richard Kurland 

  told City Lab
Â thatÂ companies like True North â
  which are known as "subsidiaries" â are common in business
  dealings when employees have a hard time getting H-1B visas.
  "What is different now is the intensity," he said. Now that
  President Trump 

  has many firms anxious
Â about whether they'll be able to
  keep or hire foreign-born workers, they are looking for
  alternatives to keep people around, even if it's not in the
  US.Â 



Tippett


, CEO of the feedback management
  company Wantoo, recently 

  told the National Observer
 that he and his co-founders had
  been discussing a version of True North for about a month before
  Spicer's announcement.




"Obviously, we've had to accelerate our efforts in light of
  recent events," he said. "But if there's one group who can move
  swiftly in situations like this, it's the entrepreneurial
  community."




Vancouver is in a unique position to accommodate new
  workers. Beyond closeÂ its proximity to California, the city
  was recently voted 

  one of the most high-tech
 in the world, and it has been
  called 

  "Silicon Valley North"
 for its booming tech sector.




According to 

  CNN
, the Trump administration is expected to release details
  of the full changes to H-1B visas within 90 days.
