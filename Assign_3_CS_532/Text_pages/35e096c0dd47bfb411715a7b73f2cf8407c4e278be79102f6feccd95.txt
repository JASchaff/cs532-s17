One of the men closest to President-Donald Trump listed “Satan” among the dark figures that inspire him in a new profile published Friday.


“Darkness is good,” Steve Bannon, the bad man Trump selected as his chief strategist, told 
fellow bad man
 Michael Wolff in 
The
 
Hollywood Reporter
. “Dick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That’s power.”


Bannon also rejected the notion that he’s a racist anti-Semite.


“I’m not a white nationalist, I’m a nationalist. I’m an economic nationalist,” he told Wolff, who let that one slide. “The globalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia. The issue now is about Americans looking to not get fucked over.”


Well, there you have it. Bannon, who thinks we have 
too many Asian CEOS
 and allowed his ultra-conservative website to run a story calling a conservative writer a “
renegade Jew
” and 
glorifying the Confederate flag
, is definitely not racist. Pay no attention to the 
white supremacists celebrating
 Trump’s team-building!
