Updated on February 16, 2017 at 2:58 p.m. ET
President Trump tried nominating a political outsider as labor secretary, first picking, in Andrew Puzder, a wealthy restaurant executive who had never served in the government. When his nomination failed on Wednesday, Trump quickly went back to the Republican establishment.
The president on Thursday 
announced
 he had selected Alexander Acosta, a former senior official in the Justice Department, federal prosecutor, and member of the National Labor Relations Board, as his new choice for labor secretary. Acosta, who now serves as dean of the law school at Florida International University, is a veteran of the George W. Bush administration with deep ties to the party establishment. As Trump noted, Acosta has already won confirmation by the Senate for three previous positions, a record that could help him avoid the fate of Puzder, who withdrew after Republican senators informed the White House that he didn’t have enough votes to advance.
“He has had a tremendous career,” Trump said of Acosta in very brief remarks at the outset of a wide-ranging press conference. Acosta would become the first Hispanic member of the president’s Cabinet.
Acosta headed the civil rights division of the Justice Department during Bush’s first term before becoming U.S. attorney for the southern district of Florida in his second. Democrats may consider him a more mainstream, palatable pick than Puzder, but they are likely to press him on his involvement with the scandal that arose over the politicization in the hiring of U.S. attorneys. Trump’s announcement won fast praise from the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, and Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who chairs the Senate committee in charge of Acosta’s nomination.
Earlier on Thursday, a narrow Republican majority in the Senate confirmed Representative Mick Mulvaney as Trump’s budget director, giving the White House a conservative voice who is expected to push for steep spending cuts.
The vote was 51-49, as every Democrat along with Senator John McCain of Arizona opposed Mulvaney’s nomination. McCain had cited the South Carolina congressman’s past support for cuts to the military budget as his reason for voting no, but the support of other Republican defense hawks in the Senate saved his nomination. Mulvaney won crucial backing, for example, from Senator Lindsey Graham, a military hawk who usually votes with McCain but gave his home-state colleague an early endorsement.
Mulvaney’s relationship with the president will be one to watch. He was no shrinking violet during his six years in the House; Mulvaney joined the renegade Freedom Caucus and was a frequent critic of Republican leaders, particularly former Speaker John Boehner. On policy, he has long favored an overhaul of Medicare and Social Security that Trump explicitly campaigned against during the election. At his confirmation hearing last month, Mulvaney signaled he would defer to the president on increasing military spending but that he would not shy away from pushing him toward entitlement changes. “I’d like to think that’s why he hired me,” Mulvaney said at one point.
Mulvaney disclosed that he had failed to pay taxes on a household employee more than a decade ago, but that revelation wasn’t enough to sink his nomination. Democrats mounted an aggressive campaign against him, but in the end, only McCain defected among Republicans.
A similar dynamic is expected for the Senate’s next confirmation vote on Scott Pruitt to serve as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Democrats and environmentalists have denounced the Oklahoma attorney general as a climate change denier, but so far the only Republican to signal opposition is Senator Susan Collins of Maine. A final vote is likely on Friday.
The Senate hasn’t formally rejected a Cabinet pick since it voted down President George H.W. Bush’s nomination of John Tower for defense secretary in 1989. But no new president has gotten 
all 
of their nominees confirmed in the last 30 years; those that become enmeshed in controversy or partisan brinkmanship (it’s often both) usually withdraw before a vote. With the exit on Thursday of Andrew Puzder as the nominee for labor secretary, Trump will continue that streak.
Check back here throughout February as we update each Cabinet pick through confirmation hearings, committee consideration, and ultimately the final votes on the Senate floor.

Department of State
Trump’s pick:
 Rex Tillerson
Background:
 He’s an oil executive. Tillerson has been the CEO of Exxon Mobil for the last decade after working his way up the ranks since 1975. It’s the only company Tillerson has ever known; the Texas native started at Exxon after graduating from college. He’s also an Eagle Scout who served as a past president of the Boy Scouts of America.
Government experience:
 None.
Why Trump likes him: 
He’s a big-time businessman who makes big deals—including with the same foreign governments with whom he’ll have to engage as secretary of state. “The thing I like best about Rex Tillerson is that he has vast experience at dealing successfully with all types of foreign governments,” Trump 
tweeted
.
Liabilities:
 Tillerson’s ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin will be the biggest potential obstacle to his confirmation by the Senate. In 2012, Putin awarded him the “Order of Friendship”—a high honor in the Kremlin, but one that will not sit well with Russia hawks in Congress.
Status of nomination:
 Confirmed on a vote of 56 to 43 on February 1.
Mike Segar / Reuters
Department of the Treasury
Trump’s pick:
 Steven Mnuchin
Background:
 He’s a banker. Specifically, Mnuchin is a former senior executive at Goldman Sachs and a hedge fund manager who bought the failed mortgage lender IndyMac from the government in 2009. He spun it off into OneWest and sold it for a huge profit five years later. Mnuchin is also a Hollywood producer whose credits include 
Avatar
, 
American Sniper
, and the 
X-Men
 movies.
Government experience:
 None.
Why Trump likes him:
 Spot the pattern yet? He’s a successful businessman. But perhaps equally as important, Mnuchin was a relatively early convert to the Trump cause and joined the campaign as national finance chairman back in April, just as the Republican was shifting from relying on his own funds to setting up a more traditional fundraising apparatus. Mnuchin made clear early on he wanted the Treasury job, and Trump rewarded him.
Liabilities:
 Goldman Sachs and foreclosures. Economic populists will see Mnuchin’s nomination by a candidate who ran against Wall Street and the “rigged” system as the ultimate betrayal. If Trump criticized Hillary Clinton for the speeches she gave to Goldman Sachs, how can he turn around and pick a man who got rich there for treasury secretary? Moreover, while Trump hailed Mnuchin for his business savvy in making a boatload off IndyMac at the depth of the Great Recession, Democrats will savage him for the foreclosures that resulted and 
highlight stories
 like that of an 89-year-old widow who blamed hounding by the bank for her husband’s death.
Status of nomination:
 Confirmed on a vote of 53 to 47 on February 13.
Alex Brandon / AP
Department of Defense
Trump’s pick:
 General James Mattis
Background:
 Mattis is a four-star Marine Corps general who led U.S. Central Command from 2010 to 2013. He commanded forces in both the Afghanistan and Iraq wars after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Mattis also worked with General David Petraeus to produce the field manual on battling counterinsurgents in Iraq.
Government experience:
 Forty-four years in the military, though none in civilian posts.
Why Trump likes him:
 For a guy who once said he probably knows “more about ISIS than the generals do,” he certainly likes hiring them for top positions. Mattis is known as a straight-shooter and a voracious reader, and Trump has gushed that he is “the closest thing to George Patton that we have.” Like Trump, Mattis is someone whose blunt talk occasionally crashes through the line of political correctness, and he has criticized the Obama administration stance toward Iran and its strategy across the Middle East. Trump seems to value his opinion: He told 
The New York Times 
that he was “impressed” when Mattis pointedly told him that torture does not work, though it did not change the president-elect’s support for the practice. Trump also seems fond of his nickname, Mad Dog.
Status of nomination:
 Confirmed on a vote of 98 to 1 on January 20.
Mike Segar / Reuters
Department of Justice
Trump’s pick:
 Senator Jeff Sessions
Background:
 Sessions has represented Alabama in the Senate for 20 years, building up a record as a staunch critic of illegal immigration and expanded legal immigration. He’s been a conservative all around, opposing the Obama administration at nearly every turn. Before his election to the Senate, Sessions served as a federal prosecutor and then Alabama attorney general. He might have had a lifetime appointment to the federal bench had the Senate not rejected his nomination in 1987 over allegations that he made racist comments and praised the KKK while criticizing the NAACP and the ACLU.
Government experience:
 Extensive. He served in the U.S. Senate since 1997 and held public office in Alabama beginning in 1981.
Why Trump likes him:
 Loyalty. In February, Sessions became the first senator to endorse Trump’s candidacy, and he has been a surrogate and close adviser ever since. Sessions’s top aides are working in the Trump transition and at least one, policy adviser Stephen Miller, might snag a senior post in the West Wing. Sessions has made his name opposing comprehensive immigration reform and citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and Trump adopted similar positions that helped vault him to the top of the GOP primary field.
Liabilities:
 The same comments that derailed Sessions’s nomination for a federal judgeship in the 1980s are likely to be front-and-center at his confirmation hearings, as will the staunchly conservative record he has amassed in the Senate. In his 1986 hearing before the Senate, Adam Serwer 
wrote
 for 
The Atlantic
, “witnesses testified that Sessions referred to a black attorney as ‘boy,’ described the Voting Rights Act as ‘intrusive,’ attacked the NAACP and ACLU as ‘un-American’ for ‘forcing civil rights down the throats of people,’ joked that he thought the Ku Klux Klan was ok until he found out they smoked marijuana, and referred to a white attorney who took on voting-rights cases as a  ‘traitor to his race.’” Sessions will face scrutiny over how he intends to enforce civil- and voting-rights laws as attorney general.
Status of nomination:
 Confirmed on a vote of 52-47 on February 8.
Gary Cameron / Reuters
Department of Homeland Security
Trump’s pick:
 Retired General John Kelly
Background:
 The military. Like Mattis, Kelly is a veteran of more than 40 years in the Marine Corps, having served as commander of the U.S. Southern Command for the final three ending in January. The jurisdiction included South and Central America, as well as the military detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Kelly also has the sad distinction of being the highest-ranking military officer to lose a child in Iraq or Afghanistan. His son, Lt. Robert Michael Kelly, was killed after stepping on a land mine in Afghanistan in 2010.
Government experience:
 Four decades in the military, including assignments as a liaison to Congress.
Why Trump likes him:
 Aside from being a general, Kelly’s deep knowledge of border security and the challenges posed by illegal immigration from Mexico and Central America are likely the reason Trump selected him. He has warned about the danger of terrorists using known drug smuggling routes to send operatives to the United States through Mexico, which was a theme for Trump on the campaign trail.
Status of nomination:
 Confirmed on a vote of 88 to 11 on January 20.
Jonathan Ernst / Reuters
Department of Health and Human Services
Trump’s pick:
 Representative Tom Price
Background:
 The deeply conservative, six-term Georgia congressman is chairman of the House Budget Committee, a leading critic of the Affordable Care Act, and an architect of Republican proposals to replace the health law. Before entering politics in the 1990s, Price was an orthopedist for 20 years in Atlanta.
Government experience:
 Twelve years in Congress and another eight in the Georgia state Senate before that.
Why Trump likes him:
 The two men don’t have much of a personal history, but Price is a close ally both of Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Paul Ryan from their years together as conservatives in Congress. Price will be instrumental in working with Republicans on Capitol Hill to devise and pass a replacement for Obamacare. In the meantime, Price’s experience in federal health policy could allow him to begin dismantling the Affordable Care Act from the inside at HHS.
Liabilities:
 Medicare, Medicare, Medicare. The biggest obstacle to Price’s confirmation is not his fervent opposition to Obamacare but his support for Ryan’s longstanding desire to convert Medicare into a voucher program. Democrats will do their best to make his confirmation hearings a referendum on this plan, particularly since Ryan has said he wants to try to pass it at some point during Trump’s first term.
Status of nomination:
 Confirmed on a party-line vote of 52-47 on February 10.
Joshua Roberts / Reuters
Department of Housing and Urban Development
Trump’s pick:
 Dr. Ben Carson
Background:
 The conservative former Trump rival for the Republican presidential nomination has no formal experience in housing policy. He’s a retired neurosurgeon renowned for pioneering a procedure to separate conjoined twins. But what Carson would bring to HUD 
is the personal experience of having grown up poor in Detroit
. He has written and spoken extensively about his upbringing, saying that his hard work and passion for reading, along with the firm encouragement of his single mother, helped him to escape the poverty of the inner city.
Government experience:
 None.
Why Trump likes him:
 Again, loyalty. Carson endorsed Trump after he dropped out of the presidential race, and though he wasn’t his most effective surrogate, he stayed with him through the ups and downs of the general election. Trump lambasted him during the primary, mocking his childhood struggle with what Trump described as “a pathological temper.” The two have long since patched things up, however. Carson was pegged for a Cabinet post early on, but it figured to be the Department of Health and Human Services, given his deep experience in medicine. Trump and Carson do appear to share an up-by-the-bootstraps philosophy toward combatting poverty, where government programs play a smaller role than they do now.
Liabilities:
 Experience, or lack thereof. Carson’s most formidable challenge may be explaining his own assessment of his qualifications to lead a Cabinet department, as explained by his spokesman, Armstrong Williams, to
 
The Hill
 
shortly after the election: “Dr. Carson feels he has no government experience, he's never run a federal agency. The last thing he would want to do was take a position that could cripple the presidency.”
Chances at Senate confirmation:
 Decent. Republicans may be predisposed to support Carson, but how he addresses this issue at his confirmation hearings could be crucial to his chances of Senate approval. Democrats are likely to challenge him both on his lack of experience in housing policy and his specific vision for running the agency and combatting poverty. They will also force him to address the sharp criticism Trump has levied at the state of urban America and his misstatements about the crime rate nationwide.
Status of nomination:
 Awaiting a floor vote. Approved unanimously by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on January 24.
Mike Segar / Reuters
Department of Energy
Trump’s pick:
 Former Texas Governor Rick Perry
Background:
 Perry served three-and-a-half terms as the governor of Texas, succeeding George W. Bush after he became president. He then ran for president twice, failing to win the Republican nomination in 2012 and then again in 2016. His experience in energy-rich Texas would, on the surface, seem to make him a natural fit, but the Energy Department is actually more of a national security agency that’s responsible for designing and protecting the nation’s stockpile of nuclear weapons. The last two energy secretaries were award-winning scientists.
Government experience:
 Three-and-a-half terms as governor of Texas, a short stint as lieutenant governor, and eight years as Texas agriculture commissioner.
Why Trump likes him:
 Perry is another example of a Republican who fought bitterly with Trump only to make amends. Early in the 2016 race, Perry was actually more confrontational with Trump than any other Republican. He gave an entire speech devoted to attacking him in July 2015, during which 
he said Trump was “a cancer on conservatism.”
 But Perry was out of the race a few months later, and he came around to Trump once he secured the nomination and campaigned for his election.
Liabilities:
 “Oops.” As Democrats will undoubtedly remind the public to no end, the Energy Department was the Cabinet post that Perry 
infamously forgot he wanted to eliminate
 during a Republican primary debate in 2011. The mocking, however, will quickly turn serious as senators force Perry to explain how he plans to lead a department that he doesn’t believe should exist. As with a few other Trump nominees, expect to hear the words “fox in the henhouse” more than a few times.
Chances at Senate confirmation:
 Very good. The “oops” moment will cause Perry some embarrassment, but barring another Texas-sized gaffe, it’s hard to see it blocking his confirmation. He should win strong support from Republicans and even a few red-state Democrats looking for a bipartisan vote.
Status of nomination:
 Awaiting a floor vote. Approved by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
Alan Diaz / AP
Department of Labor
Trump’s pick:
 Alexander Acosta
Background:
 Acosta is a veteran of the George W. Bush administration, having served as head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division and later as a U.S. attorney in Florida. He also served for a year as a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and for the last eight years as dean of Florida International University’s law school.
Government experience:
 Extensive. Acosta served in the federal government for nearly the entire George W. Bush administration in a variety of roles.
Why Trump likes him:
 Acosta has a sterling  academic and legal pedigree that Trump mentioned, having graduated from Harvard and clerked for future Justice Samuel Alito when he served on a federal appellate court. Trump reportedly also wanted a Hispanic in his Cabinet, and while that may have not been an overriding factor, Acosta’s nomination does check that box. Finally, as Trump noted, Acosta has already won Senate confirmation three times, and after the failure of his first labor nominee, Andrew Puzder, the president needed someone who could get the job.
Liabilities:
 Democrats may ask about Acosta’s time in George W. Bush’s Justice Department, which overlapped with the scandal over the politicization of the hiring of U.S. attorneys. As David Graham 
wrote
, Acosta’s deputy was Bradley Schlozman, who was faulted by an inspector general’s report for inappropriately considering politics and ideology when screening federal prosecutors. But Acosta was not formally rebuked, and that decade-old controversy may not carry as much weight as it once did.
Chances at Senate confirmation:
 Very good. On paper, Acosta appears to be a qualified nominee that Democrats will have more difficulty opposing, especially after their victory in thwarting Puzder’s confirmation.
Status of nomination:
 Awaiting a hearing.
Previous nominee: 
Andrew Puzder, who withdrew on February 15
Lehtikuva Lehtikuva / Reuters
Department of Transportation
Trump’s pick:
 Elaine Chao
Background:
 As labor secretary for the full two terms of the George W. Bush administration, Chao brings more civilian experience in the federal government than anyone else in Trump’s Cabinet. Before that, she directed the Peace Corps and led United Way. During the first Bush administration, Chao also served as a deputy secretary in the department she is poised to lead.
Government experience:
 Extensive: see above.
Why Trump likes her:
 While Trump surely appreciated Chao’s deep experience in government and Washington, there is probably another factor in his decision to nominate her for transportation secretary: Chao is married to Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader and a man who will hold wide sway over whether Trump’s agenda makes it into law. In particular, she’ll be a key player in Trump’s push for an expensive infrastructure package that McConnell and his conservative allies are cool to.
Liabilities:
 Virtually none. Given her government experience and obvious qualifications for the post, Chao might be the least controversial of any of Trump’s choices so far. Her selection even won praise from Vice President Joe Biden.
Status of nomination: 
Confirmed on a vote of 93 to 6 on January 31.
Andrew Harnik / AP
Department of Education
Trump’s pick:
 Betsy DeVos
Background:
 DeVos is a longtime philanthropist and Republican donor and the former chairwoman of the state party in Michigan. She’s been a major advocate for education reform centered on expanding charter schools and private-school vouchers. She led the advocacy group, American Federation for Children, that pushes for increased school choice for parents. 
The New York Times
 
reported
 on her successful effort to kill legislation in Detroit that would have imposed tougher accountability standards on charter schools.
Government experience:
 None.
Why Trump likes her:
 Trump has shown that he favors plucking people from the private sector who will come in and shake up a government agency, and DeVos fits that bill. She has strong support among Republican school reformers, especially those who favor both expanding charter schools and vouchers. (Democrats favor the former but not the latter.) She is further to the right on education than two other women Trump interviewed: Eva Moskowitz, a charter school leader in New York, and Michelle Rhee, the former chancellor of the Washington D.C. public schools.
Liabilities:
 Teacher unions will aggressively oppose DeVos over her support for unfettered and largely unregulated expansion of charter schools and vouchers. That likely won’t matter much to Republicans, but it will hurt her chances of winning broad bipartisan support. Conservatives who favor reduced federal power over education will question her previous support for Common Core standards and her affiliation with organizations that have championed Common Core. Anticipating that issue, DeVos 
has said
 that while she supports “high standards and strong accountability” for schools, Common Core “got turned into a federalized boondoggle.”
Status of nomination:
 Confirmed on a 51-50 vote on February 7, with Vice President Mike Pence breaking the tie
Jim Urquhart / Reuters
Department of the Interior
Trump’s pick:
 Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana
Background:
 Zinke is a Republican member of the House who was just reelected to his second term in November. He had been expected to run for the Senate in 2018, but at least for now, he’s headed for Trump’s Cabinet. Zinke served for more than 20 years in the Navy Seals before entering politics, earning numerous medals. In Congress, he has opposed the sale of federal lands but supported mining and drilling on them.
Government experience:
 Two decades in the military and two years in Congress.
Why Trump likes him:
 Trump was, not surprisingly, impressed with Zinke’s military background, and the congressman 
reportedly impressed
 Trump’s son Donald Jr., an avid sportsman who was influenced by the recommendation of the Backcountry Hunters and Anglers.
Liabilities:
 Environmentalists immediately denounced the Zinke nomination, citing his support for mining and drilling and his skepticism about climate change. And a 
recent report
 in 
The Intercept
 alleged that he committed “travel fraud” while serving in the Navy special-forces unit SEAL Team 6. But there were no other immediate obstacles to his confirmation.
Chances at Senate confirmation:
 Excellent. Many Democrats will oppose Zinke over his environmental record, but don’t expect a major fight over his confirmation. The party has a political reason for letting him go through: Serving in Trump’s Cabinet may remove him as a threat to challenge Senator Jon Tester in 2018.
Status of nomination: 
Awaiting a floor vote. Approved by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on January 31.
Albin Lohr-Jones / AP
Department of Commerce
Trump’s pick:
 Wilbur Ross
Background:
 Another billionaire, Ross is the chairman of a private equity firm that he founded and later sold. For 25 years, he led Rothschild Inc., where he made a reputation as a turnaround specialist who bought up and restructured steel, textile, and mining companies, among other industries.
Government experience:
 None.
Why Trump likes him:
 The two businessmen go back many years together and share a critical view of U.S. trade policy in the last two decades. Ross, who specialized in turning around manufacturing firms, served as an adviser to Trump during the campaign. Ross, the president-elect said in nominating him, “is a champion of American manufacturing and knows how to help companies succeed. Most importantly, he is one of the greatest negotiators I have ever met, and that comes from me, the author of The Art of the Deal.”
Liabilities:
 Yes, Ross may have turned around companies, but at what cost to workers? He will get the Mitt Romney treatment from Democrats, who are portraying him as an out-of-touch plutocrat who outsourced jobs and slashed benefits at the companies he restructured. He’ll also face questions over the 2006 explosion at a mine run by one of his companies, which killed 12 workers.
Chances at Senate confirmation:
 Very good. Expect Democrats to paint Mnuchin and Ross with the same brush, but the bigger fight will probably occur over the bigger job, treasury secretary.
Status of nomination: 
Awaiting a floor vote. Approved on January 24 by Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.
Mike Segar / Reuters
Department of Agriculture
Trump’s pick:
 Sonny Perdue
Background:
 Perdue is the former governor of Georgia, having served two terms ending in 2011. An immigration hawk, he grew up on a farm and earned a doctorate in veterinary medicine.
Government experience:
 Two terms as Georgia governor and a decade in the state legislature
Chances at Senate confirmation:
 Excellent. Perdue should have little trouble winning approval. He’s well-known to Republicans on Capitol Hill, and Georgia’s junior senator, David Perdue, is his cousin. One GOP senator who may be disappointed, however, is Charles Grassley of Iowa. Grassley 
tweeted
 earlier in January that he wanted Trump to pick an agriculture secretary from “above the Mason-Dixon line.” He was pushing for Iowa’s longtime agriculture chief, Bill Northey.
Status of nomination:
 Awaiting a hearing.
Evan Vucci / AP
Department of Veterans Affairs
Trump’s pick:
 Dr. David Shulkin
Background:
 The only Trump pick currently serving in the Obama administration, Shulkin is now the under secretary for health at the VA. He’s previously served as a top executive at hospitals in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York City.
Government experience:
 A year-and-a-half as a senior official at the Department of Veterans Affairs
Status of nomination:
 Confirmed on a vote of 100 to 0 on February 13.
Key sub-Cabinet positions
Jonathan Ernst / Reuters
Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency
Trump’s pick:
 Scott Pruitt
Background:
 Pruitt is the attorney general of Oklahoma, and in that position he has led the conservative legal fight against the Obama administration’s agenda to combat climate change. Along with other Republican attorneys general, he sued to stop the administration’s climate rules—a case that is still pending in federal court. Like Trump, he has voiced doubts about the science behind climate change and its connection to manmade activities.
Government experience:
 Six years as Oklahoma attorney general, and eight years in the Oklahoma state senate
Chances at Senate confirmation:
 Decent. Democratic leaders have made Pruitt one of their top targets among Trump Cabinet nominees, warning that his views on climate change are extreme and that his confirmation would ensure the dismantling of the Obama-era regulatory regime. They hope to pressure centrist Republican senators like Susan Collins to vote against him. Yet to defeat Pruitt, Democrats likely will need several Republicans to join them, because more conservative and politically vulnerable Democrats like Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia will probably vote for his confirmation. Manchin has already signaled as much, issuing a laudatory statement after meeting with Pruitt in early January.
Status of nomination:
 Awaiting a final floor vote. Approved by the Environment and Public Works Committee over a Democratic boycott on February 2.
Kevin Lamarque / Reuters
Ambassador to the United Nations
Trump’s pick:
 Governor Nikki Haley of South Carolina
Background:
 Haley has been considered a rising Republican star ever since she won election as governor of South Carolina in 2010. She gave her highly sought-after endorsement to Marco Rubio in the GOP presidential primary last year, and she was seen as a likely vice presidential pick if Rubio had won the nomination. But Rubio didn’t, and Trump’s early selection of Haley as his nominee for U.N. ambassador was a bit of a surprise. She has no formal foreign-policy experience, but her background as the conservative daughter of Indian immigrants undoubtedly appealed to Trump.
Government experience:
 Six years as South Carolina governor, and another six as a state legislator before that
Status of nomination:
 Confirmed on a vote of 96 to 4.
Zach Gibson / AP
Director, Office of Management and Budget
Trump’s pick:
 Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina
Background:
 Mulvaney is a hard-line conservative in the House and a founding member of the Freedom Caucus. He was a frequent critic of former Speaker John Boehner and voted for budget and debt proposals that called for steep spending cuts across discretionary and entitlement spending programs. The question is whether his support for overhauling Medicare and Social Security and his resistance to major increases in defense spending will conflict with Trump, who took opposing views on the campaign trail.
Government experience:
 Six years in the U.S. House and four years as a state legislator in South Carolina
Status of nomination: 
Confirmed on a vote of 51-49 on February 16.
Carlos Barria / Reuters
Director, CIA
Trump’s pick:
 Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas
Background:
 Pompeo was elected to his fourth term in the House in November and served on the Intelligence Committee. He drew wider attention as a member of the House Benghazi Committee and for his aggressive questioning of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during her 11-hour testimony in 2015. Before running for Congress, he served as an Army captain and then started a company that manufactured parts for commercial and military airplanes.
Government experience:
 Six years in the U.S. House
Status of nomination:
 Confirmed on a vote of 66 to 32 on January 23.

Long after research contradicts common medical practices, patients continue to demand them and physicians continue to deliver. The result is an epidemic of unnecessary and unhelpful treatments.




First, listen to
 the story with the happy ending: At 61, the executive was in excellent health. His blood pressure was a bit high, but everything else looked good, and he exercised regularly. Then he had a scare. He went for a brisk post-lunch walk on a cool winter day, and his chest began to hurt. Back inside his office, he sat down, and the pain disappeared as quickly as it had come.


That night, he thought more about it: middle-aged man, high blood pressure, stressful job, chest discomfort. The next day, he went to a local emergency department. Doctors determined that the man had not suffered a heart attack and that the electrical activity of his heart was completely normal. All signs suggested that the executive had stable angina—chest pain that occurs when the heart muscle is getting less blood-borne oxygen than it needs, often because an artery is partially blocked.

The Christian Retreat From Public Life






Emma Green










Rod Dreher makes a powerful argument for communal religious life in his book, 
The Benedict Option
. But he has not wrestled with how to live side by side with people unlike him.




Donald Trump was elected president with the help of 81 percent of white evangelical voters. Mike Pence, the champion of Indiana’s controversial 2015 religious-freedom law, is his deputy. Neil Gorsuch, a judge deeply sympathetic to religious litigants, will likely be appointed to the Supreme Court. And Republicans hold both chambers of Congress and statehouses across the country. Right now, conservative Christians enjoy more influence on American politics than they have in decades.


And yet, Rod Dreher is terrified.


“Don’t be fooled,” he tells fellow Christians in his new book, 
The Benedict Option
. “The upset presidential victory of Donald Trump has at best given us a bit more time to prepare for the inevitable.”

The Alt-Right's Intellectual Darling Hated Christianity






Anna Momigliano










The Italian philosopher Julius Evola is an unlikely hero for defenders of the “Judeo-Christian West.”




In the summer of 2014, years before he became the White House chief strategist, Steve Bannon gave a lecture via Skype at a conference held inside the Vatican. He spoke about the need to defend the values of the “Judeo-Christian West”—a term he used 11 times—against crony capitalism and libertarian capitalism, secularization, and Islam. He also mentioned the late Julius Evola, a far-right Italian philosopher popular with the American alt-right movement. What he did not mention is that Evola hated not only Jews, but Christianity, too.


References to Evola abounded on websites such as Breitbart News, The Daily Stormer, and AltRight.com well before 
The New York Times
 
noted
 the Bannon-Evola connection earlier this month. But few have discussed the fundamental oddity of Evola serving as an intellectual 
inspiration
 for the alt-right. Yes, the thinker was a virulent anti-Semite and Nazi sympathizer who influenced far-right movements in Italy from the 1950s until his death in 1974, but shouldn’t his contempt for Christianity make him an unlikely hero for those purporting to defend “Judeo-Christian” values?

The Only Thing, Historically, That's Curbed Inequality: Catastrophe






Walter Scheidel










Plagues, revolutions, massive wars, collapsed states—these are what reliably reduce economic disparities.




Calls to make America great again hark back to a time when income inequality receded even as the economy boomed and the middle class expanded. Yet it is all too easy to forget just how deeply this newfound equality was rooted in the cataclysm of the world wars.


The pressures of total war became a uniquely powerful catalyst of equalizing reform, spurring unionization, extensions of voting rights, and the creation of the welfare state. During and after wartime, aggressive government intervention in the private sector and disruptions to capital holdings wiped out upper-class wealth and funneled resources to workers; even in countries that escaped physical devastation and crippling inflation, marginal tax rates surged upward. Concentrated for the most part between 1914 and 1945, this “Great Compression” (as economists call it) of inequality took several more decades to fully run its course across the developed world until the 1970s and 1980s, when it stalled and began to go into reverse.

Milo Yiannopoulos and the Church of Winning






Ben Howe










By excusing Donald Trump’s behavior, some evangelical leaders enabled the internet provocateur’s ascent.




The Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) takes place this week near Washington, D.C., the first such gathering since Donald Trump took office. The conference purports to be a gathering for like-minded folks who believe, generally, in the well-established principles of the conservative movement, as enunciated by the American Conservative Union.


This year, aside from President Trump himself, activist Milo Yiannopoulos was briefly granted a featured speaking slot, and it caused a lot of disruption, garment-rending, gnashing of teeth, and in-fighting on the right.


Yiannopoulos, who prefers to go by MILO (yes, capitalized), is a controversial figure with dubious conservative credentials, most famous for being outrageous during speeches on his college campus tour, soberly called the “Dangerous Faggot” tour. Throughout the 2016 election, Yiannopoulos seemed to enjoy nothing quite so much as the crass, antagonistic side of candidate Trump. He didn’t just celebrate it; he rode it like a wave to greater stardom.

The Facebook Algorithm Is Watching You






Adrienne LaFrance










Here’s one way to confuse it.




You can tell a lot about a person from how they react to something.


That’s why Facebook’s various “Like” buttons are so powerful. Clicking a reaction icon isn’t just a way to register an emotional response, it’s also a way for Facebook to refine its sense of who you are. So when you “Love” a photo of a friend’s baby, and click “Angry” on an article about the New England Patriots winning the Super Bowl, you’re training Facebook to see you a certain way: You are a person who seems to love babies and hate Tom Brady.


The more you click, the more sophisticated Facebook’s idea of who you are becomes. (Remember: Although the reaction choices seem limited now—Like, Love, Haha, Wow, Sad, or Angry—up until around this time last year, there was only a “Like” button.)

Why So Many Young Doctors Work Such Awful Hours






Ryan Park










Neither truck drivers nor bankers would put up with a system like the one that influences medical residents’ schedules.




The path to becoming a doctor is notoriously difficult. Following pre-med studies and four years of medical school, freshly minted M.D.s must spend anywhere from three to seven years (depending on their chosen specialty) training as “residents” at an established teaching hospital. Medical residencies are institutional apprenticeships—and are therefore structured to serve the dual, often dueling, aims of training the profession’s next generation and minding the hospital’s labor needs.


How to manage this tension between “education and service” is a perennial question of residency training, according to Janis Orlowski, the chief health-care officer of the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). Orlowski says that the amount of menial labor residents are required to perform, known in the profession as “scut work,” has decreased "tremendously" since she was a resident in the 1980s. But she acknowledges that even "institutions that are committed to education … constantly struggle with this,” trying to stay on the right side of the boundary between training and taking advantage of residents.

Is the Leading Theory About Alzheimer's Wrong? 






Sarah Zhang










Yet another failed drug trial has prompted soul-searching about the “amyloid hypothesis.”




Last week, the pharmaceutical company Merck 
pulled the plug
 on a closely watched Alzheimer’s drug trial. The drug verubecestat, an outside committee concluded, had “virtually no chance” of benefit for patients with the disease.


The failure of one drug
 
is of course disappointing, but verubecestat is only the latest in a string of failed trials all attempting the same strategy to battle Alzheimer’s. That pattern of failure has provoked some rather public soul-searching about the basic hypothesis that has guided Alzheimer’s research for the past quarter century.


The “amyloid hypothesis” began with a simple observation: Alzheimer’s patients have an unusual buildup of the protein amyloid in their brains. Thus, drugs that prevent or remove the amyloid should slow the onset of dementia. Yet all drugs targeting amyloid—including solanezumab from Eli Lilly and bapineuzumab from Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, to add a few more high-profile flameouts to the fail pile—have not worked so far.

How to Build an Autocracy






David Frum










The preconditions are present in the U.S. today. Here’s the playbook Donald Trump could use to set the country down a path toward illiberalism.




It’s 2021, and President Donald Trump
 will shortly be sworn in for his second term. The 45th president has visibly aged over the past four years. He rests heavily on his daughter Ivanka’s arm during his infrequent public appearances.


Fortunately for him, he did not need to campaign hard for reelection. His has been a popular presidency: Big tax cuts, big spending, and big deficits have worked their familiar expansive magic. Wages have grown strongly in the Trump years, especially for men without a college degree, even if rising inflation is beginning to bite into the gains. The president’s supporters credit his restrictive immigration policies and his TrumpWorks infrastructure program.

Does Donald Trump Hate His New Job?






David A. Graham










In his first extended press conference at the White House, the president railed against his critics and unspooled a series of bitter complaints.




Have you ever had a job you loved, but one where you felt like you’d achieved everything you could? So you looked for a new job, went through a fairly grueling application process, if you do say so yourself, got the offer. Then you started the job, and you hated it. Worse, all the tricks you’d learned in your old job seemed to be pretty much useless in the new one. Did you ever have that experience?




The president of the United States can sympathize.


Donald Trump held the first extended press conference of his presidency on Thursday, and it was 
a stunning, disorienting experience
. He mused about nuclear war, escalated his feud with the press, continued to dwell on the vote count in November, asked whether a black reporter was friends with the Congressional Black Caucus, and, almost as an afterthought, 
announced his selection for secretary of labor
.
