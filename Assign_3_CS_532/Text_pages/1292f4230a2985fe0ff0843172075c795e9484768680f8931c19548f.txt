Beatty Statement on Betsy DeVos Confirmation


WASHINGTON, D.C.
 – On February 7, 2017, the U.S. Senate voted 51-50 to confirm Betsy DeVos of Michigan as the next Secretary of Education, after a tie forced Vice President Mike Pence to cast the deciding vote. Following the Senate confirmation, U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03) said:


“It is abundantly clear that Betsy DeVos is woefully unqualified to head the U.S. Department of Education. Yet, today, Senate Republicans put politics ahead of the interests of our students. Instead of listening to the millions of Americans who want a Secretary committed to public education, the Senate has confirmed a nominee more interested in undercutting our public education system—and whose only ‘real’ qualification is being a well-connected, Republican mega donor.”
