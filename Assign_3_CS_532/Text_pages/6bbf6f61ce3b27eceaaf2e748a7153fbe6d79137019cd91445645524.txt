Spicer to provide list of terror attacks that the media didn't cover

Press secretary 
Sean Spicer
 said Monday that the White House will provide a list of terrorist attacks President Trump claims the media did not cover.
Spicer's commitment to provide a list comes hours after Trump 
claimed
 the "dishonest press" won't report on terrorist attacks because of unspecified "reasons."
“We’ll provide a list later. There’s several instances …There’s a lot of instances that have occurred where I don’t think they’ve gotten the coverage it deserved,” Spicer told reporters.
ADVERTISEMENT
Trump gave 
a speech
 at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla. Monday accusing the media of not covering some terrorist attacks, implying news outlets have ulterior motives for not providing sufficient coverage.
“It’s gotten to a point where it’s not even being reported,” he told military leaders. “And in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it.”
The president did not provide any evidence to support his claim. Terrorist attacks, both in the United States and abroad, typically generate large amounts of media coverage.
Spicer argued that Trump’s “policies to protect this country, to create jobs, to grow the economy” do not receive the same amount of coverage as protests.
“He felt members of the media don’t always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered. Protests will get blown out of the water, and yet an attack or a foiled attack doesn’t necessarily get the same coverage,” Spicer said.
