Lady Gaga Fat Shamed After Halftime Performance

Lady Gaga's Super Bowl Halftime Show has been universally praised. Even my mom enjoyed it! 
But some people (trolls) have come out to hide behind their keyboards and are trying to fat shame Lady Gaga. 
A site called Styzz, which I can say I've honestly never heard of until now, is making the rounds for their highly critical take on Gaga's stomach turning the show. You can check out the article below. 
I'm not sure if the article was meant to be a "hot take" just to draw some attention to their site or if the writer of the article actually believes this....either way it's disgusting. 
Wasting no time at all, Gaga's fans wasted no time taking to 
Twitter 
to defend her. 
























Keith Kennedy has been in radio since the age of 14. As a Junior in high school he was working full time in radio. Now in his 40's, Keith is a Senior Vice President of Programming for iHeartRadio, overseeing programming for 12 radio stations in Northeast Ohio. He and his wife Kara are raising their son Landon.
