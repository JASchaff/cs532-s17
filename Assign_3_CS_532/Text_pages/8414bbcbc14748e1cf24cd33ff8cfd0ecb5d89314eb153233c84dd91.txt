  Used as part of a starter in a lesson to do with communication. The kids loved it and to be fair it is not a bad bit of music.

  This song is amazing. When I first heard Lady GaGa and Beyonce were recording a song together I never expected it to be this good! I love the lyrics in it, they are fun and really amazing. Everybody should buy telephone because it is one of Lady GaGa's best songs yet another number 1 for sure. I will defenetly be buying it!!! GaGa just keeps getting better there is no stopping her!!! <3 x

Fantastic SONG!

  When I heard that Lady Gaga and Beyonce were going to duet I was really eager to hear it. They both have brilliant voices but they both sing different styles of music so it was interesting to see what they would come out with. When I heard it, I was really surprised because the finishing result is brilliant. It has a simple but good tune the whole way through and both vocals are brilliant. The song isn't a ballad and it isn't a full dance anthem either, it's just a really good song and the lyrics too are very good. Even though both singers have powerful voices they stick to a medium but effective level of sound and it makes the song seem much more in place and gives is a better sound quality. It's a brilliant song and I definitely recommend you buy it!
