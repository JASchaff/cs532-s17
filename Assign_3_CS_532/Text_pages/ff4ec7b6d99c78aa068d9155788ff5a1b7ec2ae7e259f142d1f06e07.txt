Giving Too Much to the Students We No Longer Teach
 




 




Travel journal entry:




 July 28 – July 31, 2013, Dengcao Hutong (
灯草胡同
):


“. . . I don’t feel any particular attachment to Beijing, but I’ve already picked out a favorite seat at the local McDonald’s and started giving money to the local panhandlers.


“Very unexpectedly, I felt a strong conviction to give. . . .”




Two years of teaching in Asia had stretched me to the point of pneumonia. I had discovered a bottomless well of satisfaction in leading a classroom, and so I dove in without a respirator. Lying half-conscious in the hospital taught me that a teacher’s greatest gifts to his students are his time, energy, and heart; but, like the antibacterial drip stuck into my arm, the dispensation of a teacher’s gift must be moderated.


A rookie teacher must give but tiny morsels at first. Not that some students couldn’t handle much more, but that rookie teachers haven’t learned the self-preserving art of saying 
no
 to their deepest, most-altruistic impulses.


And more importantly, that rookie teacher in me hadn’t learned that it only takes a mustard seed of time, energy, and heart to change the life of a student. I wish I had known 
that
 before giving my left lung over to the fluids of pedagogical excess.


*          *          *


I wanted to be a writer
. Teaching was the farthest thing from my mind. Before graduating, I had proven that I could sell poetry—for 
actually
 money. The next logical course of action was finding an MFA writing program. A great disappointment hit when I discovered that graduate-level writing programs were astronomically expensive and turned out writers who appeared to be stylistic clones of each other.


Moreover, when I switched my attentions to teaching (because many great writers were teachers, so why not me?), I found that no American schools wanted to hire inexperienced English majors. But in the final semester of my senior year in university, as panic was setting in, someone told me that schools in Asia wanted inexperienced college graduates to teach English.


It seemed the only option left. I gratefully applied.


By that time, I had already travelled to twenty-plus countries, so I had no fear of indulging such globetrotting spontaneity. What I didn’t know was that I should have had more fear of the classroom—a dangerous 
terra incognita
 to those arrogant enough to believe they could navigate the little desks sight unseen. I was not prepared to interact with the tiny individuals filling those little desks.


Three days after touching down in South Korea, I was given my own classroom. The school’s idea of teacher training consisted of one mock lesson and a day of shadowing the teacher that I was replacing. The class was comprised of four students in what I believed to be the fourth grade. They hardly spoke any English, so my supremely-scientific estimation of their grade level was based on the fact that they only stood to the apogee of my belly.


I knew nothing about teaching, but I wasn’t going to admit such a thing. I overcompensated by treating the class in a very high-minded manner. I was given a curriculum, and I was going to follow it with the hardened rigor of a dyed-in-the-wool educating machine. In but a few weeks, the class degenerated into a game played with our thumbs that, when I lost, resulted in me getting slapped on the back by the students.


This silliness worked for a while. It even earned me the reputation as a “good teacher” among the students. The bad management habits that emerged, however, turned some of my classes into amusement parks of chaos.


You see, I had romanticized the entire vocation; and, when confronted with a room full of unwilling pupils, no amount of grammatical expertise was going to win them over. The first mistake was trying to connect with them on the one-dimensional level of intellectual pursuits, and not on the multidimensional plane of the human experience. The second mistake was overcorrecting and becoming the class clown.


*          *          *


But all that was over. I was sitting in a courtyard in a 
hutong
 in Beijing reminiscing. It was difficult to feel the attachment I usually get for foreign cities because I was still so attached to my students in Korea. I hadn’t let go, nor could I: I had given so much of myself to them that a great part of myself will forever be in Asia.


A great part of myself will be forever giving to the students I no longer teach.










The most erroneous assumption is to the effect that the aim of public education is to fill the young of the species with knowledge and awaken their intelligence, and so make them fit to discharge the duties of citizenship in an enlightened and independent manner. Nothing could be further from the truth. The aim of public education is not to spread enlightenment at all; it is simply to reduce as many individuals as possible to the same safe level, to breed and train a standardized citizenry, to put down dissent and originality. That is its aim in the United States, whatever the pretensions of politicians, pedagogues and other such mountebanks, and that is its aim everywhere else.

Books: “Substitute” by Nicholson Baker
 




 




I wasn’t intending on reading this 
book
 because the hyper detail seemed daunting. However, the minutiae may prove more enlightening than expected:


The entire system seems designed to drive teachers insane and prevent students from learning. Kids are on their iPads doing things unrelated to their schoolwork — playing games, listening to music, using iPad cases to beat each other over the heads. Some are even looking at “inappropriate material” in the back of the classroom. And unless a teacher is standing over them, they won’t be able to tell who is actually doing the work and who is playing games. Teachers ask for the definition of words and students just look them up online and repeat them verbatim.


—Naomi Schaefer Riley, 
New York Post


I think following the ins and outs of the minutes of the day may prove to have more argumentative power the mere summary observation.

Napalm Girl and Useful Idiocy
 




 




There’s been quite the uproar over Facebook’s decision to remove the picture of Napalm Girl. You can catch up 
here
. As you can see, most people interpreted this as censorship taken to the nth degree.


My reflexive, gut-level interpretation was that this picture was removed because the employees at Facebook are the products of their educations: Leftist wards indoctrinated into imbecility. After decades in public education, they simply had no idea what they were looking at.


Much like Kim Phuc became (literally) the image of wartime suffering, the employees at Facebook have become the image of useful idiocy/ignorance.


I’m curious to hear what all of you think. Comment below, and I’ll join you posthaste!

Raising Children with the Classroom
 




 




Over dinner the other day, I was describing to my fiancee where I felt modern education was trending. So much of what I’m being taught by my training program contains an underlying push for empathy. The following morning, I saw a bold Twitter headline advocating for the use of empathy in the classroom. I have no objections to empathy in and of itself. It’s the larger arc that is emerging that terrifies me.


More and more, teachers on the public payroll are being groomed for rolls as surrogate parents. Training us to ease into a child’s emotional life is the first step.


Curiously, every dystopian book I’ve read describes a society where children are no longer the exclusive wards of their parents. Without fail, children are raised by the government. What the books fail to describe is how a society actually gets to that point. Some books attempt to, but it always results in a tale of broad generalities and planetary trends. In reality, people only see the minutiae around them, the daily obstacles to running our lives.


Parents, please think long and hard about why the government wants so desperately to “educate” your children.

Welcome to a World of Useful Idiocy!
 




 




Deep down, I have no faith in modern education. I have no faith in modern pedagogy. Looking back on my own education, I now distrust almost everything that my public school system tried to inculcate.


And, now, some decades later, I’m trying to become a member of that priestly order of disfunction and mediocrity. (I’m hopelessly enamored with the idea of making positive change in the lives of individual students wherever I may find them—especially if they’re in the belly of the beast.)


Yet, every technique, process, and bit of technology that my teacher training program has taught me represents a menagerie of superficial, (albeit colorful) pseudo-intellectual manure. There are a few nourishing peanuts in the pile, but mostly it’s all just a bucket of tripe (if you’ll allow me to compound my metaphors) because the methods and mores never address the root problem: that of the fallacies and failures of the underlying ideological belief.


We introduce more and more information to students without ever teaching them how to make sense of it—why to care about it. It’s just noise, and we keep increasing the sensory deprivation every year by adding more and more granulated information. And now, we spend more time teaching teachers procedures than we do subject matter.


That makes teachers useful idiots.


I’ll go into more detail about the noisy nonsensicalities in future posts; but, for now, I just want to welcome everyone to the blog. Be sure to check out the

 page for more specifics as to why I do what I do.
