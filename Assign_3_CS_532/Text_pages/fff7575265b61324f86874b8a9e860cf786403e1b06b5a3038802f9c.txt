TUESDAY'S POWER LUNCH


PENCE breaks tie to confirm DEVOS -- GABBARD’s travel filing lacks details -- TRUMP beats Obama and Bush to the golf course











                        By 
Jake Sherman
, 
Anna Palmer
, 
Daniel Lippman
 and 
Zach Montellaro






Good Tuesday afternoon. REP. TULSI GABBARD
 
(D-HAWAII)
, who recently traveled to Syria and Lebanon, filed a post-trip report with the Ethics Committee, but did not disclose who she met with or what she did, as is required. Her office has not answered why.






Good Tuesday afternoon. REP. TULSI GABBARD
 
(D-HAWAII)
, who recently traveled to Syria and Lebanon, filed a post-trip report with the Ethics Committee, but did not disclose who she met with or what she did, as is required. Her office has not answered why.
DEVOS CONFIRMED
-- Betsy DeVos was confirmed by the Senate to be the next education secretary by a vote of 51-50, after Vice President Mike Pence broke the tie. It was the first time a vice president broke a Senate deadlock for a cabinet nomination. This shows the power of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who held his team together despite a barrage of opposition.
-- SENATE MINORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER
 speaking on the Senate floor: “Every mother and father in America should worry about Betsy Devos’ lack of dedication, almost negative feelings about public education. She heaps abuse on public education. Ninety percent of children are in public schools. Of course there should be discussion about her. She shouldn’t be the nominee.” 
JEFF SESSIONS’ 
nomination for attorney general will likely be voted on by the Senate sometime tomorrow evening. He’ll be approved as well, meaning the Senate is well on its way to confirming every one of Trump’s nominees. Meanwhile, the Senate Veterans’ Affair Committee approved Trump’s VA secretary choice David Shulkin 15-0.
TRUMP ON THE TWITTERS -- @realDonaldTrump 
at 7:11 a.m.: “I don’t know Putin, have no deals in Russia, and the haters are going crazy - yet Obama can make a deal with Iran, #1 in terror, no problem!”
-- NOTE: 
Trump has a fairly well-documented past of saying he has a relationship with the Russian leader. 
http://bit.ly/2llGnlJ
 
WHAT TRUMP SAID -- 
After meeting with a group of sheriffs, Trump promised to take up the fight to defend his travel ban, per pooler Carol Lee of WSJ. “We’re going to take it through the system,” he said “It’s very important for the country.” He called his order “common sense” and said it could go up to the Supreme Court, but he hopes it doesn’t have to.
-- “Kelly: I should have delayed travel ban,” 
by Aidan Quigley: “Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly said Tuesday he should have delayed President Donald Trump’s executive order temporarily banning travel to the United States from seven Muslim-majority countries … ‘In retrospect, I should have, and this is all on me, by the way, I should have delayed it just a bit so I could talk to members of Congress… to prepare them for what was coming,’ he said during a hearing of the House Homeland Security Committee.” 
http://politi.co/2lgshFu
 
ON THE SCHEDULE -- 
President Trump is scheduled to meet with Rep. Jason Chaffetz shortly in the Oval Office. For his part, Chaffetz said he is “not sure” why he is meeting with the president, saying the White House called the meeting. 
http://politi.co/2jYEBKj
TRUMP WILL ALSO MEET
 with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson at 3 p.m. in the Oval. He’ll speak with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy at 3:45 p.m. and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan at 4:05 p.m., both by phone. Vice President Mike Pence will meet with “Right to Try” advocates at 4 p.m. CNN will host a debate between Sens. Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz tonight at 9 p.m.
THIS IS SMART -- “White House chooses Ryan aide to head House lobbying shop,” 
by the Washington Examiner’s David Drucker: “The White House has tapped a veteran top aide to Speaker Paul Ryan to serve as its chief liaison to the House of Representatives, sources tell the Washington Examiner. Joyce Meyer is Ryan’s deputy chief of staff, was staff director when he served as chairman of the Ways and Means committee, and was a top adviser to him before then. Meyer is set to be named President Trump's point person for legislative affairs in the House. Marc Short is Trump’s legislative director, reporting to deputy White House Chief of Staff Rick Dearborn. Meyer is well regarded among House Republicans. Her installation into this key post is likely to be viewed favorably by House Republicans because of her Capitol Hill connections.”

PANTS ON FIRE FROM POLITIFACT -- “Donald Trump wrong that media is not reporting on terrorism any more,” 
by Louis Jacobson 
http://bit.ly/2lfQJXF
 
-- “Conway concedes some terror attacks had ‘wall-to-wall coverage’,”
 by Aidan Quigley: “Counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway conceded some of the terror attacks on a list released by the White House Monday criticizing the media for a lack of coverage did receive ‘wall-to-wall’ coverage. ‘What the president, I believe, is saying, though, is that the ones you are pointing out, we had a high number of casualties and got international coverage and wall-to-wall coverage, as well they should have,’ Conway said during an appearance on Fox News Tuesday morning. ‘We’re becoming inured to some of these attacks that don’t, thank God, lead to mass casualties but still don’t get the attention.’” 
http://politi.co/2kDfOIV
BIG MONEY -- THE NRCC 
brings in its biggest January haul ever at $10 million, according to our colleague Elena Schneider in Morning Score. More from Score: “The committee brought in $4.4 million in 2013, the most recent off-year, midterm fundraising. ... Over one-third of the money came via transfers from Speaker Paul Ryan.”
PEREZ LINES ANOTHER BIG ENDORSEMENT -- “Eric Holder endorses Tom Perez in DNC chair race,” 
by Daniel Strauss: “Former Attorney General Eric Holder is endorsing former Labor Secretary Tom Perez for chairman of the Democratic National Committee. ‘As we’ve seen since the inauguration, there is much at stake for our nation, and our democracy and our party. We need a DNC chair who is a proven fighter and a proven uniter. Tom Perez is that person,’ Holder said in a statement sent out Tuesday from Perez's DNC chair campaign team. ‘Tom not only knows how to take on big fights; he wins them. He led the effort against former Sheriff Joe Arpaio in Arizona on immigration issues, stopped discriminatory voter ID laws, and successfully took on Wall Street in the aftermath of the foreclosure crisis. He made opportunity a reality for women, immigrants, and people with the disabilities.’” 
http://politi.co/2ljNFpp
-- “Keith Ellison Is Everything Republicans Thought Obama Was. Maybe He's Just What Democrats Need,” 
by Tim Murphy in Mother Jones 
http://bit.ly/2llJCK9
 
GOLFER IN CHIEF -- “Trump beats Obama and Bush in race to the golf course,” 
by Matt Nussbaum and Josh Dawsey: “President Barack Obama made it four months into his presidency before his first golf outing as commander-in-chief. George W. Bush made it even longer, first hitting the links as president about five-and-a-half months into his first term. Donald Trump made it two weeks before heading to the golf course. … Trips to the golf course have long been a presidential tradition, and it is no surprise that Trump, who regularly touts his ownership of golf courses around the world and his own golfing talents, would gamely carry it on. ... But his enthusiastic embrace of the sport comes after he spent years mocking Obama for his own habit.” 
http://politi.co/2llMczV
 
CAMERA SHY -- “Reclusive Marvel Chairman Ike Perlmutter Appears at U.S. Central Command HQ,” 
by The Hollywood Reporter’s Eriq Gardner: “Until recently, Perlmutter's only known photo was one from decades ago. In fact, he's gone to lengths to hide his face. Famously, he once appeared at the premiere of Iron Man in disguise. On Dec. 28, 2016, however, a photograph of the exec was taken at a Trump event.”

VALLEY WATCH -- “Channeling Steve Jobs, Apple seeks design perfection at new ‘spaceship’ campus,” 
by Reuters’ Julia Love: “Inside the original Macintosh computer, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs inscribed the signatures of his team, revealing his deep concern for even the hidden features of his products. His last work – Apple Inc’s sprawling new headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. - will be a fitting tribute: a futuristic campus built with astonishing attention to detail.” 
http://reut.rs/2lfRGzk
 
SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP -- “Exclusive: How Theresa May poked fun at the size of Donald Trump’s hands,” 
by Ben Riley-Smith in The Daily Telegraph: “Theresa May has joked about the size of Donald Trump’s hands at a private fundraiser as she made light of a photograph of the pair at the White House. … ‘Thank you very much for that wonderful reception. I don’t think I have received such a big hand since I walked down the colonnade at the White House.’”

CLICKER -- OBAMA TAKES IT EASY -- 
44 is making the most of his first couple of weeks off from the job. Richard Branson invited former President Obama and Michelle Obama to the British Virgin Islands, and Branson wrote a blog on kitesurfing with the former president.

WELL, YESTERDAY DIDN'T GO TOO BADLY










02/22/17 06:54 AM EST






 There were no massive blowups to speak of. Can this continue today?






WELL, YESTERDAY 
didn’t go too badly. President Donald Trump went to the African-American History museum, where he disavowed racism and spoke out against a new wave of anti-Semitism. He didn’t tweet his thoughts until 6:23 p.m., when he said the “so-called angry crowds” at town halls around the country were “planned out by liberal activists.” There were no massive blowups to speak of. Sean Spicer seemed spry during his press briefing, too. 
CAN THE STREAK CONTINUE TODAY? 
We’ll see. At some point this week, the president will release his revised travel ban, which will suck up much of the oxygen in town. But today, Trump gets his daily intelligence briefing, has a lunch, where he will speak about the federal budget and then has a meeting about his spending blueprint with staff. Remember: Trump says he’ll have a budget soon. Like, in a few weeks. At 4 p.m., he’ll hold a legislative affairs session, where he’ll discuss tax reform, a health care overhaul and his Supreme Court strategy. Seems easy, right? 
VP MIKE PENCE
 is in St. Louis, where he’ll visit an equipment and engine dealer to discuss the economy.

ON THE HOMEFRONT










02/22/17 07:02 AM EST






Republicans are facing tough town hall crowds, and they should be wary of dismissing them.






ON THE HOMEFRONT -- “GOP lessons from the latest round of brutal town halls,” 
by Kyle Cheney in Blackstone, Virginia: “An overflow crowd here was eager to take on Rep. Dave Brat, the conservative Republican who just weeks earlier needled liberal protesters in his district and groused about all the women ‘in my grill’ over GOP plans to repeal and replace Obamacare. But with a plain-spoken approach -- and a format that didn’t revolve around live-fire questions from the combative crowd -- Brat offered his colleagues a potential blueprint for defusing tense constituent town halls that have bedeviled his Republican colleagues as they’ve been swarmed by protesters.”

“Here’s a good example of the rowdiness/frustration at Rep. Dave Brat’s town hall tonight. He took over 30 Qs, got lots of pushback.”

by POLITICO's David Siders in Mariposa, California. 
http://politi.co/2l7pmvh
-- NYT
 had Trip Gabriel in Fairview, Tennessee, Tom Kaplan in Iowa Falls and Garner, Iowa, Lizette Alvarez in Clermont, Florida, and Emmarie Huetteman from Denham Springs, Louisiana. Their headline: “
At Town Halls, Doses of Fury and a Bottle of Tums
.” They have video, too. 
http://nyti.ms/2m7bo0z
TRUMP’S REACTION -- @realDonaldTrump at 6:23 p.m.:
 “The so-called angry crowds in home districts of some Republicans are actually, in numerous cases, planned out by liberal activists. Sad!”
--Andrew Lawrence (@ndrew_lawrence):
 “Fox News runs segment at 6:15 about protestors organizing against Trump ... Trump tweets at 6:23” 
http://bit.ly/2mbc81y
-- NOTE: 
Yes, some of these protests might be more astroturf than grassroots. And there’s not a clear parallel to 2009. But in 2009, Democrats dismissed the protests too. Anger and discontent tends to spiral. So Republicans should be wary -- but even moreso, they should be prepared. We’ve seen some well-prepared lawmakers -- Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and others. The secret to getting through a town hall unscathed -- let the protesters and upset constituents talk. It’s much better than trying to cut them off in the middle of them laying out their public frustrations.
-- THE REALITY ON THE GROUND: 
It’s not just town halls -- constituents and out of state callers are bombarding many Republican congressional offices with thousands of calls. One GOP House office has increased its number of staffers and interns handling inbound calls from two to 10 people in the last month, the Republican member’s chief of staff told Playbook. He said it’s been “30 days of being bombarded” by “whatever is happening in the news cycle like Steve Bannon, Trump and tax returns, Trump did this, Trump did this.”
THE POLITICO/MORNING CONSULT POLL
 shows that 
56%
 of people want their members of Congress to hold in-person town halls. 
20% 
say tele town hall suffices.... 
34%
 said Trump's long news conference last week was excellent or good, 
29% 
said it was poor. ... 
51% 
say members of Congress spend too little time meeting with constituents ...

THE JUICE










02/22/17 07:07 AM EST






Some of the evidence from the late Sen. Ted Stevens case is returned and Jeff Butler is the new cheif of staff in Rep. Patrick McHenry's office, FIRST IN PLAYBOOK.






THE JUICE …
-- DEPT. OF LOST AND FOUND: 
Sometimes, the wheels of justice turn slowly. Really slowly. Ted Stevens, the late former Alaska Republican senator, was convicted in 2008 on federal corruption charges and lost his reelection bid that November, only to see his conviction vacated the following year when Justice Department prosecutors admitted withholding information from Stevens’ defense team. In April 2009, a federal judge ordered DOJ to hold onto all the evidence that it had from “Polar Pen,” the codename for its probe into Alaska lawmakers. Stevens died in a plane crash in Aug. 2010.
Now, more than six years after Stevens’ death, 
the Justice Dept. is finally ready to return some of the 631 items in the case, including letters between Stevens and Bill Allen, an oil-industry executive and Stevens’ pal who turned into the star government witness against him. There’s also material from Ben Stevens – the senator’s son – and Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska). Both men were caught up in the criminal probe but never indicted. There is some less interesting evidence, like manuals for the boiler and generator in Stevens’ house, which FBI agents seized during a July 2007 raid. The FBI seized $9,500 in $100 bills, as well.

BIRTHDAY OF THE DAY: Hugh Hewitt











                        By 
Daniel Lippman


02/22/17 05:26 AM EST






How/where are you celebrating your birthday and with whom? 
“The Fetching Mrs. Hewitt, my bride of 35 years, is always my date on my birthday.”
How did you get your start in journalism/politics? 
“I went to work for David Eisenhower in the summer of 1978 as he was working on his book 
‘Eisenhower at War’
 and then switched to former President Nixon’s editorial team in the fall of that year working with him and Ray Price on The Real War. A dozen years later, after law school and the Reagan Administration, I was offered a weekend radio show by AM 640 KFI in Los Angeles by George Oliva and have never been out of media (or law) since, have never looked for any job in media but have always been recruited by folks looking for a different take, and continued to teach Con Law at Chapman University Law School in Orange, California, while doing my show for Salem Media, working as an analyst for NBC News and MSNBC and as a contributing columnist to The Washington Post.”
What’s an interesting book/article you’re reading now or finished?
 “Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput’s Strangers in a Strange Land is brand new and I think must reading for any Christian in America. For fun all books by Daniel Silva, Alex Berenson, Chuck Box, Brad Thor and now Mark Greaney my newest thriller addiction. I love them all -- but start with Gabriel Allen’s first book, 
‘The Kill Artist.’”
And why? 
“Archbishop Chaput’s book is a clear-eyed, objective look at America’s transition to a post-Christian culture and what it means for Christians. Thrillers generally -- the great ones -- teach people about the world as it really is, full of threats and extraordinary professionals in the military and the IC that work to stop them.”
What is a trend going on in the U.S. or abroad that doesn't get enough attention?
 “The growth of the administrative state is throttling the use of land and with it economic growth. The EPA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service have collectively for their feet on the throats of American home building.”
How do you think the Trump presidency is going? 
“Some big wins. Some big pratfalls. Pretty much like every other start up White House. Reince Priebus is gradually helping the president bring routine and order to the White House and the Cabinet is superb. Too slow on roll out of judges and sub-cabinet appointments but a solid start marred by some obvious blowouts.”
What’s a goal of yours for the next year? 
“Applaud the Trump Administration and the Congressional GOP when it deserve it, criticize either or both when they don’t. Continue to call it as I see it on the radio, television and in print. And sell lots of copies of my new book 
‘The Fourth Way: The Conservative Playbook for a Lasting GOP Majority’
 on the merger of Trump and Ryan/McConnell agendas.”
What’s your morning routine?
 “Up between 4:30 and 5 a.m. Show prep and a pot of coffee. Make some headlines don’t just chase them.”

PLAYBOOK INTERVIEW: Suzanne Clark

The recently installed No. 2 of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is helping shepherd the powerful business lobby into the next generation.






PLAYBOOK INTERVIEW: Suzanne Clark
The recently installed No. 2 of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is helping shepherd the powerful business lobby into the next generation. “I think at the end of the day, we're pretty optimistic,” Clark said of the incoming Trump administration. “This has been eight years where people weren't focused on some of the things we think are important and now all of a sudden you have a pro-business Congress, a pro-business administration and people talking about things that are important to us like economic growth. It doesn't mean it is not hard work, but we are optimistic.” Under Clark, the Chamber has implemented a new policy council in an effort to make sure departments across the trade group have a voice, and is launching a quarterly small business survey and adding four regional summits on small business this year.

TRUMP TARGETING COMPANIES IS ‘A LITTLE SCARY’: 
“I feel like people are doing what they do with any administration, which is preparing. [It’s thinking about] how do they like to get information, what relationships do we have, how do we think about things. And I think every company now has a Twitter strategy whether they want to or not, but I also think the results of [Trump’s actions] have been pretty good. It looks like it has encouraged CEO-to-administration if not president-elect [to CEO] direct conversations and some results and some quick dialogue, and so I think people are learning that maybe it’s OK. It’s a little scary, but it leads to some conversations and maybe it’s OK.”
TRUMP NEEDS TO GET REGULATORY REFORM RIGHT:
 “I think getting reg reform right and not just repealing some of what we have seen as egregious regulations but also reforming the whole system so that agencies really have to take into account what is the impact of jobs, what is the impact on the economy so that it’s not just a system of one administration putting in executive orders and the next taking them out.”
NO ONE KNOWS WHEN CEO TOM DONOHUE IS LEAVING: 
“I’m probably Tom’s closest adviser and I don’t have any idea when he’s going to retire. I really have no idea. I don’t think he has any idea. I don’t think his wife has any idea. I’m very close to the board. Here’s what I know: He doesn’t want to retire, his wife doesn’t want him to retire and the board doesn’t want him to retire. Is he retirement age? Yeah … For me -- and I’m not even 50 years old -- I was willing to take the trade that he’s a great leader, he’s a strong leader, he’s really good at what he does, he’s a visionary, he’s a master storyteller and I learn from him and I’ll take the trade on the risk … I understand the churn and I understand the parlor game … but he has no intention of that.”

THE PLAYBOOK POWER LIST

Donald Trump won the presidency by promising to sweep away “a failed and corrupt establishment.” Now he’s coming to Washington, and he’s creating a new establishment of his own -- a motley crew of political neophytes, would-be revolutionaries and longtime insiders. Some are familiar faces on the rise; others wouldn’t know the Hay-Adams from H Street.






THE PLAYBOOK POWER LIST -- 
Donald Trump won the presidency by promising to sweep away “a failed and corrupt establishment.” Now he’s coming to Washington, and he’s creating a new establishment of his own -- a motley crew of political neophytes, would-be revolutionaries and longtime insiders. Some are familiar faces on the rise; others wouldn’t know the Hay-Adams from H Street.
For all the incoming president’s talk 
of “draining the swamp,” the ways of Washington are likely to endure--deals still need to be struck, bills passed, influence wielded. But massive change is clearly coming, and POLITICO is here to help you navigate and understand it. The Playbook Power List is our look at the 30 most powerful people and groups in Trump’s Washington. These are the people who know what's really happening and will determine what gets done and undone. This list is the product of hundreds of interviews and conversations over the course of months. Use it. Share it. Help us make it even better.

THE PLAYBOOK INTERVIEW -- TOM PEREZ










01/11/17 06:59 AM EST






The outgoing labor secretary is a top candidate to become the next Democratic National Committee chairman, and he is out with a new campaign priority: creating an in-house chief cybersecurity officer at the party committee.






THE PLAYBOOK INTERVIEW -- TOM PEREZ
The outgoing labor secretary is a top candidate to become the next Democratic National Committee chairman, and he is out with a new campaign priority: creating an in-house chief cybersecurity officer at the party committee.
“I THINK THIS OFFICE
 should report directly to the chair and, among other responsibilities, have them proactively monitor the DNC for attacks and breaches and I think equally importantly, I want to make sure this chief cybersecurity officer is working with all of our state partners because I’m confident we can fortify the front door and prevent future breaches, at the same time, it’s critically important all the windows are closed as well,” Perez said in a Playbook Interview.
Other takeaways:
-- Republicans should take hacking seriously:
 “This is a very, very serious breach and it’s clear to me if the tables had been turned and Hillary Clinton had won with the assistance of Russian hackers, Democrats would be holding 15 different hearings right now. This is a very very serious threat to our Democratic process and that is why I want to make sure we do everything in our power to prevent future attacks and I think the Republicans on Capitol Hill ought to be as concerned as anyone about protecting our democracy.”
-- Debate calendar should be set earlier: 
“One of the things I certainly would recommend is that we set a debate calendar for the presidential cycle well in advance of when we know who the candidates are going to be. That to me is an example of how we can do things that will ensure that we are not in any way shape or form putting the thumb on the scales of justice.”
-- DNC needs to focus more on small-dollar fundraising: 
“We need to make sure that we’re going to every corner of the country to build a robust fundraising operation. I was very impressed with how, for instance, Senator Sanders was able to attract small dollar donors … [We need to] go to school on that because we do have a small dollar program at the moment, but I know we can do better. With the input from all of our stakeholders we can figure out a way to do just that. That was a remarkable accomplishment.”
-- DNC race isn’t a redux of Clinton-Sanders primary: 
“I’ve worked very closely with everybody in every wing of the party because I’ve fought a lot of fights side-by-side with them. The big tent of the Democratic Party is our greatest strength. I think there is an acute understanding that everybody has that the biggest challenge we have, not just as a party but as a nation to address the threats posed by Donald Trump.”
-- No position on the future of super delegates… yet: 
“There is a commission looking at that right now and one of the things I’ve been doing a lot of is active listening … I’ve heard from folks on both sides of the aisle there and I’ve heard compelling arguments both ways. Part of what I’ve committed to do in this was to listen and to listen very carefully and that’s exactly what I am doing right now.”
