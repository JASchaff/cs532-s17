Due to an overload of the same questions, now for the world to enjoy:
''The Dance in the Dark Project F.A.Q. - Q & A" ! :D
---
Q: OMG! Is she the real Lady Gaga?
A: No, she's not. Her name is Lizalo Galama. (Notice the initials... Coincidence can be a bit freaky...)
Q: Then who the hell made this?
A: A very passionate group of young Dutch filmmakers, dancers, fashion artists and actors.
Q: Oh my... Why?
A: We wanted to support Lady Gaga and everything she stands for and we wanted to do so by doing what each one of us loves to do the most, whether it's filming, producing, directing, dancing, designing or acting. No financial gain was made out of this production since it was completely non-profit. Also, see the Behind the Scenes to have a look on set, meet the people that made this and hear in depth why we decided to take on this production that turned out to be one of the most unique experiences we ever had. 
Watch The Behind the Scenes here:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVV8uU...
Q: Why Dance in the Dark then?
A: Well... How long have you been hoping a music video would sooner or later be released for this amazing song with it's brilliant lyrics? :)
Q: I want to learn the choreography!
A: Great! You can find our tutorial here, don't forget to post a video response of you (and your friends) dancing it! :)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313Tjn...
Q: So, how many people were actively involved in the making?
A: Overall around 82 people. 15 actors, 6 dancers, 28 crew members and 33 associates.
Q: Then how long did it take to make?
A: The total production span took around 6 months. After 4 months of preparation; stages were built in 3 weeks, costumes sewed in 2 weeks, shooting took three days and the video was edited in two weeks. -- Yeah, we know... it took us much longer then we expected as well.
Q: I shouldn't ask but... How much did it cost?
A: Due to the fact that the people in our cast and crew participated and offered the usage of their equiptment absolutely free of charge we managed to get the total production cost at around 15.000,- dollars. Something we're very proud of considering the result :).
Q: Oh my god! Then who payed for this?
A: Several foundations and organisations supported the overall concept of the production and therefore were willing to help. There were also a lot of crewmembers that decided to each take a few bills on them to ensure the production could maintain the quality we were aiming at.
Q: How on earth did you managed to get all her tattoo's?
A: Based on the available pictures on the internet, we had an image illustrator digitally redraw the pictures and then we had them custom size printed as temporary tattoo's.
Q: Must have those! - What camera did you say you used?
A: The video was shot on a RED One with Mysterium-X sensor and RED Prime lenses in 4K Redcode RAW. But we just call him FRed.
Q: Uh... Wow! - So will you make another Gaga video?
A: We'd love to! But we hope people are able to understand that gathering the required amount of money and people to get this done was something we were really only able to do once :(.
Q: Has Lady Gaga herself seen the video then?
A: Truth be told, we haven't got the slightest idea. And although (as explained in the behind the scenes) this video is dedicated to her and we'd absolutely love to hear from her. The fact that you're reading this right now is far more important since Lady Gaga exists within her fans. Making a tribute to her is making a tribute to all little monsters all over the world :). 
Q: Can I contact you guys?
A: Of course you can! We'd love to hear from you! :) reach director/producer Remy Schepers at remyschepers@gmail.com
Q: Is it on IMDb?
A: Yes, it is

 feel free to vote if you have an account! :-)
Q: Do you have twitter so I can stay on track regarding future projects?
A: Yup,

Q: So whats next for you guys?!
A: Currently working on an English psycho drama called Black Premise;
