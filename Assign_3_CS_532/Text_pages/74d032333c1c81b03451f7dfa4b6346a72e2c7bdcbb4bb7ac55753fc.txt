1.
 In case you missed Lady Gaga‚Äôs Super Bowl halftime 
performance
 on Sunday, it was really awesome and great and she flew around in the air for a while swinging and swaying. (It looked terrifying, IMO.)

2.
 And while many were 
impressed
 by her dangerous stunt, others made comments about Gaga trying to copy Pink, who is known to do aerial work during her shows.
