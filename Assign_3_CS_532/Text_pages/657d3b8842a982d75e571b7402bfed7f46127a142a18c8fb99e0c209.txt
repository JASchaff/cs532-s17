The Trump administration wants to fast-track the Dakota Access pipeline -- and has already directed the Army Corps of Engineers to abandon the full environmental review ordered by President Obama, urging the agency to speed through a final permit.



If the pipeline's completed, oil spills and water and climate pollution will be inevitable, and the continued desecration of indigenous rights will be a tragedy. Now, more than ever, we need you to stand in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux tribe to demand a 
full environmental review
 and ultimately the end of this terrible proposal.



If we succeed in gaining at least a closer look, this pipeline will be forced into a years-long review of impacts to drinking water, tribal rights and the climate -- a review that will buy time and open the door to other challenges. 




But that won't happen unless millions of Americans speak up. So please take action and demand a full review from the Army Corps today.
