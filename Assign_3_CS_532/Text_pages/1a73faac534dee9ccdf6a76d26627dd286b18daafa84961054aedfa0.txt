When Metallica announced they'd be 
performing at this year's Grammy Award
s ceremony, this coming Sunday, February 12, 2017, they promised something big. Looks like the word got out on what that performance might be.


Earlier today, Lady Gaga tweeted a video of commercial for the ceremony this Sunday announcing that she would be joining the legendary Bay Area thrashers for what is sure to be a must-see performance:

But what song will they be performing? Will Gaga sing a long to a Metallica song like the obvious choice "Enter Sandman?" Or perhaps something a bit more obscure? Metallica already 
performed "One" at the Grammys
 with some help from renowned pianist Lang Lang, perhaps Gaga can help them with "Master of Puppets?"


Gaga is no stranger to heavy metal. She has said on numerous occasions that Iron Maiden 
changed her life
. She loves Black Sabbath (her 
favorite song is "Black Sabbath"
), she 
lounges around in metal shirts
, hangs out 
with metal gods
 and randomly 
crashes metal shows at SXSW
 from time to time.


As soon as video surfaces of the performance, we will have it for you here. Metallica are also nominated for best metal performance. See all the rock/metal nominees 
here
.


Metallica also announced an intimate show 
they're playing immediately after the Grammys
, I wonder if Gaga will show up there too?
