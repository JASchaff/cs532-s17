Al Franken slams new Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos: 'The most incompetent Cabinet-level nominee I have ever seen'

  After Betsy DeVos was 

  confirmed as secretary of education
 on Tuesday, Democratic
  Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota issued a blistering statement,
  calling her unqualified for the job.


  "It's not a job for amateurs who don't know the first thing about
  education," 
the
  statement said
. "I voted against the nomination of Betsy
  DeVos, a billionaire Republican donor, because she is the most
  incompetent Cabinet-level nominee I have ever seen."


  Franken's statement comes on the heels of one of the most
  contentious confirmation processes a secretary of education has
  seen. The position is typically confirmed without major
  opposition.


  An 

  advocate for alternatives
 to public schooling, DeVos
  championed charter schools and school-voucher initiatives in her
  home state of Michigan, where she served as chairwoman of the
  state's Republican Party.


  Democrats have argued that she is unqualified to be secretary of
  education, a view that centered on a confirmation hearing in
  which DeVos was 

  grilled on several issues
 and often gave vague answers or
  said she was currently unable to provide a response. In what was
  perhaps the most widely circulated exchange, when asked about
  guns on campuses, DeVos said guns could "protect from potential
  grizzlies."










  This isn't the first time Franken has had harsh words for DeVos.
  During DeVos' confirmation hearing in January, Franken asked
  DeVos for her opinion on measuring student progress â
  specifically, on the debate about proficiency versus growth. When
  she appeared to get stuck on the answer, Franken 

  criticized her
 for not knowing about what he believed to be a
  basic topic.


  "This is a subject that has been debated in the education
  community for years," Franken said. "It surprises me that you
  don't know this issue."
