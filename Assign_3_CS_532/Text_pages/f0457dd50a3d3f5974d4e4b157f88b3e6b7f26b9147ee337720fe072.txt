Rosie O’Donnell Just Offered to Play Steve Bannon On SNL

Rosie O’Donnell, actress and longtime nemesis of Donald Trump, just offered 
to join the cast of Saturday Night Live
 and play the role of Trump’s top advisor, Steve Bannon.


The idea of O’Donnell playing Bannon picked up steam online after it was suggested to really help dogpile onto the administration and she wasted no time jumping at the opportunity.


Trump has famously flipped out over Alec Baldwin’s portrayal of him on the show, and this past weekend Press Secretary Sean Spicer called the show “mean” after Melissa McCarthy’s hilarious impression of him.




Now, in order to complete the job of humiliating Trump’s closest staff, O’Donnell wants to portray Bannon, a blow that would likely send Trump over the edge.


Not only because of his longtime feud and hatred for the actress, but because, according to those close to Trump, he was furious that a woman was chosen to play Spicer.


“More than being lampooned as a press secretary who makes up facts,” 
a source close to Trump told Extra
, “it was Spicer’s portrayal by a woman that was most problematic in the president’s eyes.”


He also told the site that he thought the portrayal was “not considered helpful for Spicer’s longevity in the grueling, high-profile job in which he has struggled to strike the right balance between representing an administration that considers the media the ‘opposition party,’ and developing a functional relationship with the press.”


The role would also be wonderful payback for the actress who told People in 2016, that 
the bullying she receives from Trump was the worst in her life
, even more than in high school.


“It was national, and it was sanctioned societally. Whether I deserved it is up to your own interpretation,” she said.


This role would offer her more than payback without having to stoop to his level of bullying to do so.


Now some are even suggesting that O’Donnell should play Trump for one night and really set the president off. This idea seems so popular that a site has launched for people to pledge to 
donate to her charity of choice
 should she accept the role, if offered.


While her playing Trump seems unlikely, she is ready to jump into the role of Bannon and there is little doubt that Trump and his allies would explode on Twitter afterward.
