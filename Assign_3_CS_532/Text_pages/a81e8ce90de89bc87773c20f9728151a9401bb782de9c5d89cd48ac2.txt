Billionaire philanthropist 
Betsy DeVos
 was confirmed Tuesday as President Donald Trump‚Äôs Education Secretary, bringing her 
rocky confirmation process
 to a historic conclusion.


Vice President Mike Pence offered the 51st vote in favor of DeVos, making him the first U.S. Vice President ever to cast a tie-breaking vote for a Cabinet member. Even as other Cabinet nominees have faced opposition, DeVos became the subject of a particularly heated public campaign in recent weeks.


Republican Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski 
announced last week
 that they would not vote for DeVos, bringing the vote to a 50-50 tie. In a 
late-night standoff
 on the Senate floor Monday, Democrats denounced DeVos and tried ‚Äî unsuccessfully ‚Äî to convince another Republican Senator to vote against her.


DeVos, a school choice advocate, was heavily criticized after her confirmation hearing last month, when she 
struggled to answer questions
 about key issues in education policy. Protesters across the country have campaigned against her confirmation, organizing rallies and flooding lawmakers with tens of thousands of phone calls.

Finally something might be done about our failed education system. Too long our young grads have been sent into

society ill equipped because of a lack of adequate education. The decision where their kids get their education needs to be in the hands of their parents not some bloated education apparatus whose only concern in many cases was not in the best interest of those entrusted to their care. School choice will make all schooling better through competition. We owe it to our children the chance to compete in the tough after graduation world.

I am Republican and a Trump supporter. I approve of the decisions he is making. I am a retired special educator of good standing who is still highly alert and wise in the Federal IDEA law. I sincerely hope that someone such as me will be included in her advisory council.
