Lady Gaga
's exultant halftime performance at Super Bowl LI is an official hit, both in terms of ensuing catalog sales and in TV ratings. 
FOX reports
 that Gaga's 13-minute gig pulled an astounding 117.5 million viewers, making it the second-most-viewed halftime show in Super Bowl history, behind Katy Perry's set at Super XLIX, which drew 120.7 million viewers.
Billboard
 reported yesterday that following Gaga's Super Bowl cameo, sales of her discography had soared by over 1000% percent, with 
Joanne
 single "Million Reasons" standing as her current highest-selling individual song. In fact, with just one day's sales, "Million Reasons" enjoyed its best sales week to date, moving 45,000 units on the day of the Super Bowl alone (Feb. 5).






FOX also reports that Super Bowl LI drew 172 million total viewers across all platforms, with 111.3 million watching on FOX alone. The 172-million mark makes the Super Bowl, which saw the New England Patriots come from behind to defeat the Atlanta Falcons 34-28 in overtime (the first-ever Super Bowl OT), the most-watched program in U.S. television history.
