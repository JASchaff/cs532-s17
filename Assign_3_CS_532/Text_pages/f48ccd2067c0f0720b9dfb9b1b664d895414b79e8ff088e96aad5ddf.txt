Trump Will Be Furious When He Finds Out People Have Been Writing Postcards to ‚ÄòPresident Bannon‚Äô

#PostcardsToBannon And #PresidentBannon Sure To Rile Thin-Skinned Trump


One of the latest criticisms that is clearly getting under the skin of President Donald Trump is that he is not calling all of the shots in the White House. Critics have now jumped on this and exacerbated it by mailing postcards to Trump‚Äôs Chief Strategist Steve Bannon and 
bestowing on him the title ‚ÄúPresident Bannon‚Äù
.








Trump has recently Tweeted out defense of his power by saying ‚ÄúI call my own shots‚Äù, but the criticisms have been piling up, 
as noted by Fox News
. One of the most damning recent reports is that Trump signed the Executive Order giving Steve Bannon an open door to the National Security Council 
without full knowledge of what he was doing
.


Critics have now jumped on this and are beginning to make things even worse for Trump. Postcards and letters are being sent to the White House addressed to President Bannon in an effort to pull this wound open a little more.

Here are some of the best to enjoy and don‚Äôt forget to send your own message to President Bannon:
