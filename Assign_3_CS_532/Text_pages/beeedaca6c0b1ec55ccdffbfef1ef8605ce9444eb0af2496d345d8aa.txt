original post below


President Trump’s most controversial pick for his Cabinet, Betsy DeVos, is expected to be confirmed by the narrowest of margins today on the floor of the U.S. Senate. For the first time, a Vice President will break the tie for a confirmation: VP Mike Pence is expected to cast the deciding 51st vote, as all Democrats and Independents are joined by two Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, in opposing the nominee, leaving just 50 yes votes among the remaining Republican conference.


Democrats kept the Senate floor open, arguing against DeVos all night long. The final vote is expected to occur after 12noon today. Far below, we have our anticipated tally and the cloture vote from Friday. Refresh this page frequently for updates, we will load up the tallies and nays as they are cast.
