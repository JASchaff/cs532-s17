The new Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos. (File photo: Erik Lesser, EPA)


Today was another first in U.S. history. 
Betsy DeVos
 was 
confirmed
 as Secretary of Education thanks to a tie-breaker vote by Vice President Mike Pence ‚Äî the first time a U.S. vice president has broken a tie to confirm a presidential Cabinet candidate. (The VPOTUS is the 
president of the Senate
. You knew that, right?)

6 things college students need to know about Betsy DeVos, Trump‚Äôs pick for Education Secretary


Politicians and commentators with a range of opinions have been speaking out on Twitter since the news of the confirmation broke, expressing¬†general concerns about the future public education in general and about specific issues like the treatment of LGBTQ youth in schools.






The Senate has confirmed Betsy DeVos as the nation's 11th Education secretary in a historic vote:

President Trump maintained¬†DeVos would serve as a necessary change-agent, working against ‚Äúthe failed status quo.‚Äù 






Senate Dems protest to keep the failed status quo. Betsy DeVos is a reformer, and she is going to be a great Education Sec. for our kids!


‚Äî President Trump (@POTUS) 
February 7, 2017




Conservative political pundit Charlie Kirk noted the positive effect DeVos will have on socioeconomically disadvantaged children. Kirk is 21 years old and attended Wheeling High School, a public high school in Wheeling, Illinois, according to his 
LinkedIn profile
.






With DeVos being confirmed millions of poor kids and families will have their lives changed. Ending the cycle of poverty! 
#SchoolChoice


‚Äî Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11)

But many public school advocates oppose DeVos ‚Äî including current students. Numerous public university students shared success stories of their experience in the public education system and concerns about the future of public ed under DeVos.






As someone who went to a "high risk" public school and am now at the top of my class at a public university I can say that she is mistaken

If I have to go to class at my public university soon with Betsy Devos as the new education secretary I will die

love that in my first year at a public university Betsy DeVos is going to be secretary of education!!! Gonna be fun!!! Whoooo!!!


‚Äî kari (@kari_merrill98)

I just want to appreciate my public university today because DeVos will burn it down tomorrow.


‚Äî Anu Vora (@entreprANU)

No coincidence the moment 
#devos
 was confirmed the sky unleashed a torrential downpour on the campus of a public university.

As someone who went to private school and now goes to a public university I oppose the confirmation of Betsy DeVos, this is a huge setback.


‚Äî Francesco Corso‚ùÑ (@xenofrancesco)

I went to a public school and I'm doing pretty well in college 
@BetsyDeVos
 fight me

Serious question: now that VP Pence has forced DeVos through the Senate, will students be held accountable for plagiarism? DeVos wasn't.


‚Äî Kaivan Shroff (@KaivanShroff) 
February 7, 2017




On the other hand, maybe this is a moment when more focus will be put on improving public university systems.






Everyone is complaing about 
@BetsyDeVos
, and I'm just sitting here in an already failing public university.

One specific point of contention was DeVos‚Äô views on policies surrounding LGBTQ youth in schools. National organizations such as Lambda Legal spoke out against the confirmation. DeVos has been criticized by various pro-LGBTQ groups for her funding of anti-LGBT conversion therapy and anti-gay marriage movements.






We're already in court for 
#transgender
 students & are ready to file more cases if we must. Take note, 
@BetsyDeVos
.

All students includes students with disabilities, students of color, LGBT+ students‚Ä¶ She knows this, right?

DeVos herself tweeted about her victory in good spirits, saying she aims to help ‚Äúall US students.‚Äù






I appreciate the Senate's diligence & am honored to serve as 
@usedgov
 Secretary. Let's improve options & outcomes for all US students.
