                                            Rosie O'Donnell Down With Replacing the Grim Reaper as Steve Bannon on 'Saturday Night Live': 'Here to Serve'                                        









                                            Rosie O'Donnell is ready to channel Steve Bannon.                                        





















                                            After Melissa McCarthy's impressive take on White House press secretary Sean Spicer on last week's Saturday Night Live, the longtime Donald Trump critic told fans on Twitter that she's up for playing chief strategist Steve Bannon -- should she get the call.

                                            "I am here to serve - Alec has Trump - Melissa has Spice - I would need a few days to prepare - so if called - I will be ready," the 54-year-old comedian tweeted on Monday night.

                                            O'Donnell reiterated the sentiment, responding to another follower's tweet, "Available - if called i will serve!"

                                            O'Donnell also praised McCarthy as a "comedy god" after her turn as Spicer over the weekend.

                                            O'Donnell would certainly be quite a casting change for 
SNL
, which currently has Bannon portrayed as the Grim Reaper.                                        




SNL's Steve Bannon is a little too handsome.
