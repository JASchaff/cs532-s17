Did 'The Simpsons' Predict Lady Gaga at the Super Bowl LI?


According to rumors, the animated series made several predictions that came true during the 2017 Super Bowl game.

















            362        
























 
 


CLAIM



    The Simpsons correctly predicted various incidents that took place during Super Bowl LI.    
















MIXTURE










RATING






MIXTURE






WHAT'S TRUE




At least one scene from an episode of 
The Simpsons
 appeared to predict pop star Lady Gaga's halftime show during the 2017 Super Bowl. 






WHAT'S FALSE




A few images showcasing these "predictions" from 
The Simpsons
ORIGIN
On 5 February 2017, rumorsÂ 
appeared
Â that the popular animated television series “The Simpsons”
Â 
had once 
predicted
Â Lady Gaga’s halftime performance at Super Bowl LI, comparing a scene on the animated show to her descent to the stage on the field to kick off her show:
The stillÂ from the television showÂ is real, and was taken from a 2012 episode of “The Simpsons” called “Lisa Goes Gaga”:

Of course, there are a few problems with this prediction. For example, “The Simpsons”
Â 
version of Lady Gaga was not performing at the Super Bowl.Â Also, as with otherÂ 
predictions
 from “The Simpsons,”
Â 
the show was actually spoofing a previous event, not attempting to predict a future one.
In this case, the seriesÂ was gently mockingÂ Lady Gaga’s visually arresting (and occasionally outlandish) stunts duringÂ concerts (the singer performed a similar 
one
Â in 2011, when she ziplined into a concert on “Good Morning America”)Â and showedÂ the singer in several outfits similar to ones she had alreadyÂ worn:

Some people also claimed thatÂ the show
Â 
had predicted the light display at Super Bowl LI, which was not accurate:
The cowboy hat in the bottom right corner of the graphic did not come from the Â same episode of “The Simpsons,” butÂ in one from 2005 called “Homer and Ned’s Hail Mary Pass” in which characters Homer Simpson and Ned Flanders planned a Super BowlÂ halftime show. The 
cowboy hat
 image is real, as are the fireworks âÂ but but fireworks were invented long before they appeared on thatÂ 2005 episode.
Additionally, Lady Gaga’s show did not feature a giant cowboy hat, and the lights display at Super Bowl LI was 
created
 with drones (filmed earlier in the week) rather than fireworks.
One lastÂ rumor that circulated after the 2017 Super Bowl was that “The Simpsons” actually predictedÂ the game’s finalÂ score:
This is a doctored image. The real scene did not show the Atlanta Falcons or the New England Patriots on the scoreboard, and did not show the final score at 34 to 28. The real imageis from season 28’s episode “
The Town
“:
As spooky as the predictions may seem at first glance, a closer look shows that it they areÂ actually nothing more than a combination of digital manipulation, wishful thinking, and keen observations.
