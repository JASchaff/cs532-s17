Well, this will be quite the collaboration!
E! News has confirmed that 
Lady Gaga
 and 
Metallica
 will be performing together at the 
2017 Grammy Awards
.
A fan site first tweeted an unaired promo for the Grammys in which Gaga and the metal group's performance was teased. Gaga's big news comes on the heels of what's already proving to be an incredible week for the pop star. After a critically acclaimed (and 
fan obsessed
) performance at the 2017 Super Bowl, Gaga announced her 
world tour
 for 
Joanne
.

This is far from Gaga's first time performing at the Grammys. Last year she was on hand to pay tribute to 
David Bowie
, but it will be Metallica's first appearance since 2014. Mother Monster isn't nominated for any awards this year as 
Joanne
 was released after the deadline, but the metal group's "Hardwired" is up for Best Rock Song at this year's show.






Previously announced performers include 
Katy Perry
, 
Kelsea Ballerini
, 
Lukas Graham
, 
Demi Lovato
, 
The Weeknd
, 
Alicia Keys
, 
Maren Morris
, 
Beyoncé
, 
John Legend
, 
Cynthia Erivo
 and more.






Tune in to 
E! News
 at 7 p.m. and 
Fashion Police
 at 8 p.m. on Monday, Feb. 13 for complete coverage of the 2017 Grammys.
