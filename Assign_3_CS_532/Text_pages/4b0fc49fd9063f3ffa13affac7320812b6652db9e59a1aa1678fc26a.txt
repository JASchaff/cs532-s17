So things have gotten serious.










The American government and its military are in the clutches of a cabal of profiteers and right-wing ideologues. Again. 


Is this worse than the government of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, who are directly responsible for the deaths of 
250,000 people
 in the Iraq War — 134,000 of them civilians, including children — and in large part for the 
rise of the Islamic State
? 


Or worse than George H.W. Bush, whose Gulf War killed over 
20,000 Iraqis
 and resulted in 
159,000 
American soldiers returning home with illnesses and injuries serious enough to warrant medical compensation?
⁠ 


Obama is not stainless either: recall 
the 16-year-old boy
 in Yemen murdered by American drones, or the many other civilians recently killed in 
American attacks
 there, fanning revenge-based radicalization.


Slaughter in the name of American "freedom"


When even Cheney and George W. Bush criticize the policies of the new Republican president, I suggest the answer to my initial question must be yes: this administration is worse than any we’ve seen yet. But comparisons are not the point. The point is that in four years, the outrageous, racist boondoggles currently arousing so much justified protest — whether they are 
head fakes
 or not — may look like minor opening gambits for larger, far more horrific events.


One such event could be another unjust war where thousands of innocents are slaughtered in the name of American “freedom”— something to rally Trumpian populists around the Republican punchbowl. 


These citizens are not only in southern 
states
 like Alabama (where 1.3 million people voted Trump). They live in “blue” northeastern states like New York, which had double as many votes for Trump as Alabama (2.6 million), and in “left coast” bastions like California (3 million for Trump). And there are plenty of Canadians who will cheer on any war by America, however unfounded and mercenary.


Sabre-rattling with Iran is underway now, and last week 
The Guardian
 
reported
 on Bannon’s March 2016 statement that in the next five or 10 years America is “going to war in the South China Sea ... no doubt.” 


A 
USA Today
 
article 
also quoted Bannon from successive Breitbart podcasts: “Some of these situations may get a little unpleasant," he said in November 2015. "But you know what, we’re in a war. We’re clearly going into, I think, a major shooting war in the Middle East again."


In December 2015, he expanded on his views about ongoing threats to America. "You have an expansionist Islam and you have an expansionist China.... They're motivated, they're arrogant, they're on the march. And they think the Judeo-Christian West is on the retreat.”
 


The notion of a threatened "Judeo-Christian West" is precious to Bannon. 
Journalist Paul Blumenthal has 
reported 
that in a 2011 speech to a Republican women's group, he stated that the 
“Judeo-Christian West is collapsing. It’s imploding. And it’s imploding on our watch. And the blowback of that is going to be tremendous.”


That same year, according to Blumenthal, Bannon said to
 the conservative Liberty Restoration Foundation: “This is the fourth great crisis in American history. We had the Revolution. We had the Civil War. We had the Great Depression and World War II. This is the great Fourth Turning in American history.”


Bannon's
 ideas about war are not informed only by his twisted geopolitical analysis, but by a theory about 80-year cycles of history, in which societies are reshaped by cataclysmic wars. 
Bannon
 learned this from a book called the 
The Fourth Turning, 
as David Von 
Drehle
 
reported
 in a 
Time
 magazine profile. "
A party guest recalled meeting [
Bannon
] as a private citizen, and 
Bannon
 telling him that he was like Lenin, eager to
 'bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today's Establishment.'"


A war, if Bannon can provoke one, would serve Bannon's ideas about history. It would also serve his political ends.


The slogan on Breitbart News' online store appears to glorify the idea of war. Steve Bannon is the former executive chair of the 'news' site that has been called out for racist and sexist content. Screenshot taken from Breitbart's website. 
The Dubya Doctrine


History has seen a steady procession of American leaders charge into war for political expediency. Mickey Herskowitz, a journalist and former ghostwriter for George W. Bush, said that two years before the 9/11 attacks, the presidential hopeful was already meditating on the political benefits of going to war with Saddam Hussein. Herskowitz revealed this in a 2004 interview with Russ Baker, author of the Bush family expose 
Family of Secrets.


"It was on his mind," Herskowitz recounts in the book. "He said to me: 'One of the keys to being seen as a great leader is to be seen as a commander-in-chief.' And he said, 'My father had all this political capital built up when he drove the Iraqis out of Kuwait and he wasted it.' He said, 'If I have a chance to invade... if I had that much capital, I'm not going to waste it. I'm going to get everything passed that I want to get passed and I'm going to have a successful presidency.’" 










It was in war, Baker notes, that George W. Bush "saw the opportunity to emerge from his father's shadow."


That moment came for Bush in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, as Herskowitz told Baker: “Suddenly, he's at 91 percent in the polls, and he'd barely crawled out of the bunker."


The Dubya Doctrine of war as an image booster is part of the long and generally 
undiscussed history
 of American imperialism— myriad U.S.-backed coups and black ops that have installed or propped up dictators all over the world. If there is to be a war, quick, relatively small ones are preferred by amoral, soul-dead leaders eager to be seen as great commanders-in-chief. They offer leaders the chance of a shot on the battleship prow and not too much blowback in the polls. But quagmires and catastrophic cascades are frequent outcomes. 


It’s all part of the “
odious continuum
,” to use journalist Glenn Greenwald’s phrase, of blood spilled by American leaders. Given past comments and current actions, it’s a good bet Steve Bannon and his pet president will join the parade, and do so with relish. 


They know the power of fear and anger, and they serve their dark masters well. That 
49 per cent
 of the American public favour Trump's attempted ban on immigrants from select Middle Eastern countries— notably, 
none of those
 like Saudi Arabia that house Trump Organization assets— shows just how effective the idea of a dangerous “other” is.


China and Iran are ideal for Bannon. He is busy 
framing
 both countries as godless threats to the "Judeo-Christian West"— something harder to do with post-Communist Russia. If that seems like an oddly medieval angle to take, it’s not: it’s supremely tactical. Over 
70 per cent
 of Americans identify as Christian, and a 
2010 Pew poll
 found that 41 per cent of of Americans believe Jesus will return by 2050. 


I would guess that those who believe the world will end in under 40 years are likely to be less concerned about the costs of war— or about keeping the planet alive— than those who don't. In this light, Trump’s recent 
promise
 to “totally destroy” political limitations on churches, so that pastors can endorse candidates “from the pulpit,” might be another well-planned move in an intelligent, long-term strategy to manipulate the American public. 


Christianity itself is not the real problem. Christians are only one demographic Trump and Bannon want to rile up. The real problem is men like them— men happy to invoke religion to achieve evil and destruction on a grand scale.


We should keep in mind that Bannon’s belligerence is not only an American issue. Canada and many other nations will be profoundly impacted by, and possibly drawn into, whatever war he drums up.

Unlock the black box


So what do we do? Here are five early considerations: 


First, be forewarned. In classic fascist style, Bannon wants to unfurl the military banners in public squares, and give beaten-down Americans something to rally around. He is probably already picking out his suit. 


Second, alongside current legal actions to protect immigrants and minorities, progressives should be thinking long-term, tactical, and preemptive. How 
do 
you stop a war that hasn’t begun? I don’t know. But we need to start thinking about that, whether we live in America or not. Moderate Republicans — that dying breed — may be pivotal in helping head off catastrophe. Liberal religious institutions will also be critical. 


Third, business leaders, traditionally skittish about taking positions on government policies, need to take a stand for their principles and make it known that they oppose another needless war. There was an excellent 
commentary
 on this in 
Conscious Company
 magazine by Gerry Valentine, in which he challenged business leaders to “climb down out of our idealist ivory towers, and to create broader alliances.” Those who are part of organizations like the 
Social Venture Network
, 
Business for Social Responsibility
, 
Net Impact
 and 
BALLE
 should begin urging these groups to issue preemptive statements and start working now with political representatives to head off another war. 


Fourth, progressives should start consciously reaching out to businesses and forging alliances. To quote U.S. strategist Mike Lux: “The progressive movement will not win substantive change in this country without strong and successful business leaders being on our side.” The world of business is traditionally a black box for progressives — a huge advantage for right-wing conservatives, for whom that is not the case. Business is the greatest ally progressives have never thought of, and the two need to work together more. A lot more. 


Lastly, we need to go deep and get grounded spiritually and emotionally. Get conscious of how you feel, and don’t allow yourself to be run by a reactive hatred of the bully archetype or paranoid visions of apocalypse. We need to stay in our hearts. That means being open to possibility, and focusing more on what we all have in common than what separates us.


If we don’t, we won’t be able connect with each other effectively, lead effectively, or reach out to those who may not agree with us in many (or most) things — but who also don’t want to see another generation slaughtered to serve the careers of a cabal of despots. 


Time to circle up. Let’s go.

Excellent. The best way to avoid war is to avoid surprise attacks. It's the surprise that activates the fear centers in the brain, which lead to fight or flight--the fear centers don't lead to cooperation. This article gives me a way to interpret Bannon's strategy, so that I'm not blind-sided as I was with W's strategy. Please write more.

Thanks Peter. May be writing more on this, we'll see. To learn more of Bannon's strategy in aligning conservatives in a kind of holy war, see these two articles on Bannon and the Vatican:

Mr Bridge doesn't mention




Chris Crowther
 | 
Tue, 02/07/2017 - 19:04
 






Mr Bridge doesn't mention Canada once in this article, so I'm skeptical of Mr Bridge's intent with this piece. He has a book to sell that will be release in May 2017....why doesn't he examine what worked for Canada in the past?


We avoided W's Iraq war. Canadians protested valiantly and pressured Chretien to say NO to W and his false pretense. We could have done the same for Afghanistan in 2001, except for NATO's article 5.


Canada's role as peace keeper was front and centre in schools as I was growing up. The narrative was that we fought WWII and Korea, and then worked to keep the peace. Where is that discussion now? Under the pretense of NATO we send troops to confront "Russian Aggression" in Ukraine, meanwhile our NATO ally in Turkey, Erdogan, punishes civil society and imprisons journalists with reckless abandon and not one iota of criticism from NATO? 


So if we are going to avoid becoming cannon fodder, Canada needs progressives to pull their heads out of our asses. The class of progressives who has time to write and argue about this stuff is dependent on finance - the same finance that Bannon used to get his "fuck you money" via Goldman Sachs and Seinfeld (did you know every time you watch a Seinfeld re-run, Bannon gets a royalty?)


http://www.thewrap.com/steve-bannon-seinfeld/


The truth is we can use the same tools to build an economy that cuts people in to the pie, instead of out of it. But we've got to pay writers to write about it, and not to speculate like this and distract us with facile conjecture. Bridge admits he has no clue how to prevent a war - and yet he sees himself as a person who can offer advice on how to do so.


If Wall Street was built on the sale of WWI bonds, then so called progressive leaders like Bridge should have been able to already build an anti-Wall Street that harnesses the wasted human energy from the corporate sector's failings.

Chris, I appreciate your insights here on Canada's foreign policy history and current entanglements. You're spot on that we need a conversation on that in Canada. This article does mention Canada (once, in passing) but my focus here was simply to raise a red flag about Bannon, not review past Canadian strategies for dealing with American belligerence. That is something I would love to read, as it’s something I’m not well-versed in. 


I hear your frustration with our politico-economic system and I share it. That said, if you feel this piece is “facile conjecture,” I invite you to write another that would bring greater intellectual rigor to the conversation. I would welcome that, I would read it, and I would do my best to assume first that you are a caring person and someone with substance to offer as we all face the rise of global fascism. 


Your comment that I am a “so called progressive leader” is puzzling to me, as I don’t know anyone who calls me that. I am not a policy expert nor a progressive leader, unless having organized a protest demonstration or two in years past qualifies me for that title. 


And I’m afraid I don’t fit the characterization of being part of a “class of progressives who has time to write and argue about this stuff” because they are “dependent on finance.” I’m no more dependent on finance than anyone in Canada who has an RRSP and makes CPP contributions. I’m a concerned citizen writing an op-ed— for no remuneration whatsoever—while taking time away from other paying work that I can ill afford to neglect. 


Ad hominem attacks on each other don’t help. When we already facing such brutal global realities, and we share a desire to improve things, rather than assume the worst of each other, let’s give each other the benefit of the doubt. 


It’s tempting in stressful times to make those we read into authorities who stand for the ignorance of the larger system, when there are so many things— the world of finance, for one— that deserve comprehensive and withering critique. Rather than making straw men (or women) out of progressives who share our goals and scorning their motives and failings, I think the better course is to direct our passionate pens and volunteer time to constructively further the conversation about what is to be done.

Our government may present

Our government may present better, but it's playbook is the same: Promise whatever will win the election with no intention of following through on most; Reopen coal mines; Approve all the LNG, pipelines, hydro, etc.; Ignore scientists and even common sense; Trample the rights of Indigenous people and even defy repeated court orders; Sign global agreements (COP21, UNDRIP) with no intention of honoring them; Cozy up to dictators and oppressive regimes (China, SA, Castro, etc) and defend them; Unethical behaviour; LIE frequently; Stack rulings to benefit you and yours first (FPTP); Reward your friends (P3s, projects, grants, approvals) no matter the law or economic/environmental cost. 


Trudeau has backloaded funding for most of his Indigenous promises to year 4 and after the next election. 2 court orders and 15 months since he took over and no change in funding for Indigenous kids. That is racism. Even his claims of feminism are bs when he refuses to legislate equal pay or even pay women in the civil service equally. Talk is cheap and the country is being destroyed.

Good commentary here on Trump




Tyee Bridge
 | 
Thu, 02/09/2017 - 12:05
 






Good commentary here on Trump's base of support and how much of it is detached from the Republican party. 


"But of course the entire Trump phenomenon has nothing to do with policy or ideology. It has nothing to do with the Republican Party, either, except in its historic role as incubator of this singular threat to our democracy. Trump has transcended the party that produced him. His growing army of supporters no longer cares about the party. Because it did not immediately and fully embrace Trump, because a dwindling number of its political and intellectual leaders still resist him, the party is regarded with suspicion and even hostility by his followers. Their allegiance is to him and him alone.


And the source of allegiance? We’re supposed to believe that Trump’s support stems from economic stagnation or dislocation. Maybe some of it does. But what Trump offers his followers are not economic remedies — his proposals change daily. What he offers is an attitude, an aura of crude strength and machismo, a boasting disrespect for the niceties of the democratic culture that he claims, and his followers believe, has produced national weakness and incompetence. His incoherent and contradictory utterances have one thing in common: They provoke and play on feelings of resentment and disdain, intermingled with bits of fear, hatred and anger. His public discourse consists of attacking or ridiculing a wide range of “others” — Muslims, Hispanics, women, Chinese, Mexicans, Europeans, Arabs, immigrants, refugees — whom he depicts either as threats or as objects of derision. His program, such as it is, consists chiefly of promises to get tough with foreigners and people of nonwhite complexion. He will deport them, bar them, get them to knuckle under, make them pay up or make them shut up."

Important addendum for all those in North America (and beyond) appalled by the ascendancy of Trump: a post-election visit to Walt Disney's hometown. By Thomas Frank who wrote "Listen Liberal" which takes righteous aim at the failure of liberals to address serious issues of trade and finance. Maybe there is something to that whole urban elites thing after all.
