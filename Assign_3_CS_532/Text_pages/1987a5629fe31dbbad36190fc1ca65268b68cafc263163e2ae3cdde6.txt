Rosie O’Donnell Prepared to Play Steve Bannon for SNL

Melissa McCarthy’s 
portrayal of Sean Spicer
 on Saturday Night Live last weekend was pretty amusing—much more amusing than her social justice Ghostbusters reboot anyway. Now another female performer wants to play a male member of Trump’s inner circle on the sketch comedy show. Trump hater/hated 
Rosie O’Donnell is offering her services
 to play the conniving Presidential adviser.


On the heels of actress Melissa McCarthy’s caustic portrayal of White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on “Saturday Night Live,” comedienne Rosie O’Donnell says she’s available to play President Donald Trump’s controversial adviser Steve Bannon.


On her Twitter feed Monday night, O’Donnell responded to suggestions that she play Bannon by saying “available — if called I will serve.”


McCarthy lampooned Spicer last weekend in a “Saturday Night Live” sketch where she taunted reporters as “losers,” fired a water gun at the press corps and used the lectern to ram a Wall Street Journal journalist.


Rosie certainly has the face for it.

Reportedly, 
both Trump and Spicer
 hated McCarthy’s parody of the press secretary.


Trump allegedly disliked it because it was done by a woman, but we know that Trump doesn’t have a 
universal
 aversion to cross dressing.




Maybe he only has a problem with women pretending to be men.


I hope O’Donnell gets her chance to play Bannon, not because I think she’s particularly entertaining but because I’m curious to see whether Trump can withstand the urge to launch another public anti-Rosie tirade.
