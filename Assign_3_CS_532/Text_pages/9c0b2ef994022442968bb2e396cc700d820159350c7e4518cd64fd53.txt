WASHINGTON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's  choice to lead the Labor Department has admitted to employing an  undocumented immigrant as a house cleaner, according to multiple  media reports on a revelation that has derailed previous Cabinet  nominees.


Andrew Puzder, chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants  Inc, is one of several Trump nominees who faced  strong opposition from Senate Democrats and progressive groups.  He has criticized an overtime rule championed by the Obama  administration and opposed raising the minimum wage to $15 an  hour.


An aide for the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor  and Pensions said a week ago that the panel would not  "officially" schedule a hearing until it receives Puzder's  paperwork from the Office of Government Ethics.


Some political strategists said that could signal trouble  for the fast-food executive.


Several media reports quoted a statement from Puzder late on  Monday as saying he took action as soon as he learned that his  housekeeper, whom he and his wife had employed for a few years,  was not legally permitted to work in the United States.


"We immediately ended her employment and offered her  assistance in getting legal status," he said in the statement,  which was cited by the Huffington Post, the New York Times, and  other media.


He said he and his wife paid back taxes for  employing the maid to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and to  the state of California.


Previous presidential appointees have run into problems over  immigration issues.


Linda Chavez, nominated for labor secretary by President  George W. Bush in 2001, allowed a Guatemalan woman who was in  the United States illegally to live in her home and gave her  spending money.


Zoe Baird, President Bill Clinton's nominee for attorney  general in 1993, withdrew from consideration after she admitted  hiring two illegal immigrants as a driver and a nanny and not  paying their Social Security taxes.


Another Bush nominee, former New York City police  commissioner Bernard Kerik, withdrew his name from consideration  for homeland security secretary in 2004 after he disclosed that  questions had been raised about the legal status of a former  housekeeper and nanny.
