  Donald Trumpâs longtime enemy and 

  a target of his in the 2016 presidential debates
, Rosie
  O'Donnell,Â just announced via TwitterÂ that she is
  available to play the role of mysterious and highly
  controversialÂ 
Trump strategistÂ 
Steve
  Bannon on âSaturday Night Live.âÂ 




  People on social media suggested O'Donnell for the role, and she
  responded enthusiastically.

  For now the Grim Reaper plays Steve Bannon on "SNL," in a dark
  joke about the strategist, though we donât know whoâs under the
  costume. In the next sketch starring Alec Baldwin as Donald Trump
  â and hopefully Melissa McCarthy as press secretary Sean Spicer,
  given her hilarious performance over the weekend â the Grim
  Reaper could show up and remove the mask, revealing
  OâDonnell.Â 




  On Sunday morning, OâDonnell sang McCarthyâs praises after seeing
  her performance as Spicer.

If this whole thing plays out, it would not be surprising
  to seeÂ 
angry
  tweets
 about it from Trumpâs personal Twitter
  account.Â 





  The feud between the two 

  started in 2006
 when OâDonnell criticized Trump on âThe
  View,â and the two tweet criticisms of each other often. Trump
  has called OâDonnell "a real loser" and "a woman out of
  control."Â
