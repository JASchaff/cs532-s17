Betsy DeVos is the U.S. Education Secretary by the slimmest of margins.  Vice President Mike Pence was forced to cast the deciding vote today after the Senate ended in a 50-50 tie to confirm DeVos. 
{ "position1" : { "type" : "live", "id" : 6043, "name" : "NBC News Radio", "description" : "The news you want, when you want it" } }
 Two Republicans voted against President Trump's nominee, forcing Pence to cast the first tiebreaking vote in history for a Cabinet nomination.
