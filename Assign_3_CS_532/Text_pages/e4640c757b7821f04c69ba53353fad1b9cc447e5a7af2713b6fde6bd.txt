“Late Night” host Seth Meyers has had it with Kellyanne Conway’s “insidious lies.” 


“So, if you’re embarrassed you 
didn’t remember the Bowling Green massacre
, don’t,” Meyers said after 
showing Conway’s interview
 with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews. “
It never happened
. Like the Titanic crashing into the Hindenberg. When Lee Harvey Oswald was shot by a unicorn. But this clip is a perfect example of the ways in which 
the more fantastical lies
 of the Trump administration overwhelm the smaller more insidious lies.”


Meyers went on to explain that the news media was focused on the hilarity of the Bowling Green Massacre, but they neglected another claim by Conway that was false. In the interview with Matthews, Conway also claimed that President Barack Obama also banned Iraqi refugees in 2011. That never happened. ThinkProgress reported that the interview 
featured three major lies
 that were missed due to the Bowling Green mockery. 


Meyers cited a 
Vox
 
report
 that revealed Obama never stopped the refugees, he merely ordered a review of them while refugees continued to flow into the country. 


“So, even while they’re lying they’re distracting us from worse lies,” Meyers said. “That’s like telling people you have a girlfriend in Canada when actually you have a dead body in the basement.” 












Over the weekend, the White House tried to soften the failure of Trump’s executive order banning immigrants. The efforts were crushed 
when Trump tweeted out accusations instead
. 


“It’s impossible,” Meyers said. “Trying to strike a moderate tone with Trump as president is a little bit like trying to coyly seduce a women with a bullhorn.”


Trump’s response to the court striking down his ban was to 
tweet out attacks on the judg
e that issued the order. Meyers said that his anger seems to stem from the fact that he only recently discovered there were two other branches of government. 


“Oh, no!” Meyers exclaimed doing his Trump impression. “Checks and balances?!”












Meyers went on to mock Gov. Chris Christie (R-NJ), who was sent out as a surrogate over the weekend to attack the decision by the judge. Meyers tried to explain to Christie “the bridge to Trump’s heart is closed, bro.”


While Trump seems to be angry about “bad people” coming into the country, Meyers noted that he seems to be 
ignoring actual bad people
 like 
Vladimir Putin
.
