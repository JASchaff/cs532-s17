President Trump's longtime nemesis says she is willing to play Trump's top adviser on "Saturday Night Live."
Rosie O’Donnell on Monday tweeted that she would be up for portraying chief White House strategist Stephen Bannon on "SNL" if asked to do so, after a report about the president's anger at the show's portrayal of his team led to a social media push for her to get involved.

Actress 
Melissa McCarthy
 portrayed White House press secretary 
Sean Spicer
 on "SNL" this past weekend, drawing rave reviews, including from O’Donnell.

Trump was bothered by the comedy show’s portrayal of Spicer, particularly the fact that he was played by a woman, according to a 
Politico report Monday
.
That report led to a wide social media push for other actresses to play Trump’s male advisers on SNL to try to get under the president's skin.
O’Donnell and Trump have been engaged in an ongoing public feud for more than a decade. Trump has called the comedian a “pig” and “a woman out of control,” while O’Donnell has said the president is “not a self-made man” and frequently rails against him on Twitter.
Trump has focused anger at SNL during his campaign and frequently since Election Day, particularly over actor 
Alec Baldwin
’s portrayal of him.
The president tweeted in December that the show was "totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse."
