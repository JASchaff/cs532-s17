With so many on the Left flipping their lids over Betsy DeVos’ confirmation as education secretary, now would be a great time for a deep breath and a sanity check.

Enter Sen. Tim Scott with some much-needed perspective:

I am thankful for all the calls, for the passion we’ve seen about education policy for the past two weeks.

— Tim Scott (@SenatorTimScott)

We need strong public schools, as well as strong options for parents to choose the best option for their kids.

— Tim Scott (@SenatorTimScott)

The fact remains no Secretary of Education has the power to “destroy public schools” – and no one would.

Exactly.

Let’s be clear-there are 1000s of low performing schools across this nation. You can hold the floor forever…but it won’t change that fact

We will work with Secretary DeVos to strengthen all of our schools, and to make sure quality education is available to all.

Because without education, incarceration rates go up, unemployment goes up, lifetime earnings go down.

So while some want to continue to put band-aids on a system that isn’t working for a lot of kids, I do not.

— Tim Scott (@SenatorTimScott)

I want true reform that strengthens public education and gives parents a choice for their childrens’ future.

— Tim Scott (@SenatorTimScott) 
February 7, 2017




It is a life long passion for me, and I am committed to working for ALL of our kids.

Seems like a platform we can 
all
 get behind. Don’t you agree, liberals?
