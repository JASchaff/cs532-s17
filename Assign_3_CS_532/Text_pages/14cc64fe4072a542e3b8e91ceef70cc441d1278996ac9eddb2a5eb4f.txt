Lockstep Republicans in the U.S. Senate have just voted to confirm 
anti-public education
 activist 
Betsy DeVos
 as Secretary of Education. In a historic move, Vice President Mike Pence was forced to cast the deciding 51st vote, the first time a sitting vice president has had to do so.


Just two Republican Senators, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, had the courage to stand up to President Donald Trump by voting against DeVos.

NCRM encourages you to call your Senator to thank them for their "no" vote or to denounce their support for the unqualified soon-to-be-sworn-in DeVos: 
(202) 224- 3121.


UPDATE: 12:35 PM EST –
Mike Pence will swear DeVos in this afternoon.


This is a breaking news and developing story. Details may change. This story will be updated, and NCRM will likely publish follow-up stories on this news. Stay tuned and refresh for updates.
