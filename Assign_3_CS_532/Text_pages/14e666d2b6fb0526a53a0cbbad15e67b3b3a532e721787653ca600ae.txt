SHE WAS THERE, SHE REMEMBERS IT


Kellyanne Conway “misspeaks” a lot. Like sometimes she means to order the steak, and instead she shouts, “I am in the process of 
eating my hand off
 RIGHT NOW!” Other times she’s trying to describe why Donald Trump’s Muslim ban is necessary, and she says it’s because of that horrible event they don’t teach the school children, because it never happened, called the 
Bowling Green Massacre.
 (OK fine, 
there was one in 1643,
 when white people slaughtered a fuckton of Native Americans, including babies in a really bad way. Kellyanne Conway does not know that.) When she said that to Chris Matthews, though, it was an accident. She meant the Bowling Green Kerfuffle That Didn’t Happen In Bowling Green! Or something! Honest mistake, happens to all of us. Uh oh, getting breaking news right now that the Harrisburg Dinosaur Fisticuffs are happening, with dinosaurs, in Harrisburg!


Just kidding, we must have misspoken.


But it turns out Kellyanne Conway is “just kidding” quite frequently when it comes to the Bowling Green Massacre, which did not happen. She cites it often! 
Cosmopolitan
 magazine broke the story, citing an interview it did with Conway, where she said “Bowling Green Massacre” and spun around three times in a row or something:


[I]n an interview with Cosmopolitan.com … on Sunday, Jan. 29, Conway used the same phrasing, claiming that President Barack Obama called for a temporary “ban on Iraqi refugees” after the “Bowling Green massacre.” (The quotes did not appear in either of two stories recently published on Cosmopolitan.com.)


“He did, it’s a fact,” she said of Obama. “Why did he do that? He did that for exactly the same reasons. He did that because two Iraqi nationals came to this country, joined ISIS, traveled back to the Middle East to get trained and refine their terrorism skills, and come back here, and were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre of taking innocent soldiers’ lives away.”


Cosmo decided to factcheck the blueberry princess, because literally if her mouth is moving, she’s lying, and found that, for instance, according to the Justice Department, the men did not go back to Iraq for training. It’s a given at this point that the men did not inflict a massacre on Bowling Green. But Conway told the magazine this just proves her point because here’s why:


In a follow-up text exchange Sunday night, Conway wrote, “Frankly they were terrorists in Bowling Green but their massacre took place in Iraq. At least this got clear-thinking people to focus on what did happen in Bowling Green.




NOTHING. HAPPENED. IN. BOWLING GREEN! Let’s also remember that Conway tells this story as a way of claiming President Obama did THE SAME THING and banned Iraqi refugees when these arrests happened. There was a slowdown, and there were new vetting processes implemented, but no, Obama 
did not do THE SAME THING.


Anyway, doesn’t matter, because the Bowling Green Massacre is apparently Kellyanne Conway’s very favorite story, like it’s even better than the Bible or 
The Poky Little Puppy
. The Daily Beast 
found Conway
 telling TMZ, also on January 29, that Trump’s Muslim ban is necessary because Obama did THE SAME THING when he banned Iraqi refugees (again, Obama didn’t) after the “Bowling Green Attack,” because we guess you don’t 
have
 to call the Bowling Green Massacre a “massacre” if you don’t feel like it. You can call it an “attack” or a “spree” or “the Corvette museum,” as long you’re clear about the fact that a terrible thing happened in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and it was Obama’s fault.




SHE MERELY MISSPOKE. Like a hundred times! You would do the same thing if you were a terrible person and a liar and on Donald Trump’s payroll and your job was to lie and obfuscate and confuse the American public about what President Steve Bannon is doing to destroy the country.


Hey, did you hear the 
Trump administration offered
 to have Kellyanne Conway come on CNN on Sunday, but CNN was like “Fuck that liar, because she lies”? FAKE NEWS, WHY IS CNN COVERING UP THE BOWLING GREEN MASSACRE?

Conway lied about the massacre that never happened, which in itself is revolting. She lied about “innocent soldiers” being killed. She lied about it being a mistake. And she used her lies to attack the media, first for not reporting something that never happened, and then for attacking her for lying.


And from just looking at her swift physical and mental deterioration, it appears the lies are really taking a toll.  Her haggard look has fallen to repugnant and rotting….her inner Kellyanne is emerging.

GoutMachine








Remember: It’s not a lie if you believe it’s true.














Bill D. Burger








“I read it on the internet….”  ;)


















Dr. Rrrrrobotnik








The good news is that Kellyanne has no idea how to make a Big Lie. A Big Lie has two primary ingredients: that it be not easily disprovable (i.e. takes more than 30 seconds to explain), and that a bunch of other people reinforce it.


This is a lie that’s dismissable in a sentence. It didn’t happen, nothing happened at all. And the other Trumpkins are just letting her flail, since they’re a bunch of power-hungry assholes who want to see a rival (and a womyn, no less) go down in flames.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/02/07/who-benefits-from-bannons-economic-nationalism/?utm_term=.e5b4a8e557dc


Of course, this assumes that the primary effects of Bannon’s economic nationalism are distributional in nature. Indeed, the behavior of financial markets to date suggested that the pluses of corporate tax cuts and fiscal pump-priming would outweigh and symbolic efforts at protectionism. But it’s beginning to dawn on some observers that maybe the Trump administration is actually serious about erecting all of these economic barriers to the outside world. We’re already seeing Silicon Valley planning to relocate foreign workers to Canada. If there are more immigration restrictions to come — and it seems like that is the case — then the United States economy could start feeling the negative effects of a massive brain drain.














Carpe Vagenda








Right. Because god forbid the taxes on those well-paying jobs come here.














Norbrook








The truly sad part is that the manufacturing jobs that most of these areas are talking about are 
dependent
 on exports, so they’re going to get fucked big time.  The other big thing is that most of the manufacturing jobs are disappearing not because of foreign competition, but because of automation.  The “good old days” when you could graduate high school, and as long as you had a strong back and a tolerance for repetitive labor, get a factory job are long gone.

“President Trump is now speculating that the media is covering up terrorist attacks”


No, WaPo. He is not speculating. Speculation is an honest attempt to extrapolate from valid data. He’s fucking lying his ass off.














Zippy W Pinhead








Yup- he lied. Then the WH lied about what he said. Then they lied some more.














Proud Liberal








If his lips are moving, he’s lying.


















CogitoErgoBibo








I saw a (pretty believable) theory that he knows they covered all of these events.  The point was to have media go nuts and start talking about past terrorist events and help Cheetoh Boy defend his Muslim ban by reminding us about them.  


Luckily, I’ve seen a number of outlets change tact  They’re now saying that the events cited by Trump would not have been prevented by the ban.  So suck on that, Trumpy.














Jamoche








I’ve seen another one that he thinks they didn’t because he hadn’t noticed it, so when he had a briefing about them he assumed that this would be news to everyone else too. Now, that assumes he had a briefing that he paid attention to.














Creepoman








He’s using searches of news reports about terror attacks to come up with his list of terror attacks that haven’t been covered in the news. **my forehead is permanently flattened from headdesking**






















Biel_ze_Bubba








Too late.  The Trumpanzees know it happened, Alex Jones will have the story on how it was covered up, and there’s going to be a documentary about it on the History Channel.


I think the reality-based community needs to stop denying these things, and go with, “Yes, we know, but that was in an alternative reality, and it’s not really a problem in this one.”  Just to get the conversation started.














Bill D. Burger








Trump does go to Infowars (gawwd, I wish I were joking) and as soon as Alex Jones supports Conway and explains how the BGM was much worse that she described and the vast liberal media covered it all up, the Trumpanzees will howl their approval and Kellyanne will say, “I told you so.”  ___ And Trump will tweet: “…dishonest media won’t report Bowling Green Massacre terror attack. Endangers Americans. SAD.”

White Nationalism in the White House


Lacy MacAuley, an activist and member of the Washington DC Antifascist Coalition, told The Independent: “I absolutely think Steve Bannon is connected to a network of white nationalists. Just in the last few years there have been contractual obligations between white supremacist James O’Keefe at Project Veritas and Breitbart.”


Mr O’Keefe was known, she said, for taking down institutions and organisations via fake news.


“I would say that Steve Bannon is the advocate for white nationalism in the White House and there’s no doubt in my mind on that. It’s not just through Breitbart, it’s through his entire line of work.”

As countries around the world figure out how to influence the new U.S. administration, China is going straight to the top: Trump’s immediate family. In bypassing more traditional diplomatic channels such as the State Department, China is looking to open a more direct link to help avoid a trade war or military confrontation after Trump signaled a willingness to challenge Beijing’s red lines on Taiwan and the South China Sea.

From the Bloomberg piece: Ivanka later posted a video of Arabella singing a song in Mandarin, further helping to quiet criticism after her father, President Donald Trump, broke with convention by not sending a personal New Years greeting.

I misread some of that and thought the writer was saying Arabella was Trump’s daughter.

See also Chinatown. She’s my sister. She’s my daughter. Etc.

Four dead in Ken-tuck-y

Arabs are cutting us down

Should have been done long ago.

What if you knew them

And found them dead on the ground

How can you run when you know?

I know this is a shock for you, but we’ve NEVER had a qualified education secretary (at least not a Tory one and that’s what counts here) that’s why out education system sucks (it’s the worst in Europe, not just the EU). Here it’s not about educating, it’s about learning (as in learning facts to regurgitate on an exam paper; we test kids at 7, 9, 11, 16 and 18 (there used to be testing at 14, too but the then Tory government was forced to scrap that) but they STILL want to test at 3 (nursery ‘entrance exam’) and 5 (entrance to Reception)).


Our last education secretary (Michael Gove, serial liar, you may have heard of him) actually had the gall to claim “teachers have no clue what’s best for kids” when the NUT and NASUWT, our two largest teaching unions, overwhelmingly voted to strike, once again, over SATs (our SATs are nothing like yours). Just let that sink in. 


I am not a parent, but I’ve always believed that education, particularly Early Years, infant and primary education should be FUN; kids should WANT to go to school, not wake up terrified of having to sit an exam at SEVEN YEARS OLD! Our education system is draconian, prevents learning, doesn’t allow bright kids to take lessons with the year group more suited to their ability (I recall the story of a 5-year-old Bangladeshi boy at an inner-city school in Birmingham some years ago. He was a maths prodigy, but our education system didn’t – and still doesn’t, as far as I know – allow kids to sit in on lessons that match their ability. His parents couldn’t afford a private tutor (inner-city Birmingham is one of the most impoverished areas in the whoie of the EU, not just the UK), so the school’s headmistress made an arrangement with the local secondary school for him to sit in on A-Level maths lessons (which he still found too easy!). She (the head) drove him there herself, with the full consent of his parents. The LEA (local education authority) and the department of education conducted a witch-hunt against her, accusing her of destroying his education. She lost her job, and ended up on the DfE blacklist meaning she could never again work in a state school. Despite the support of her union, the boy’s parents and the school, she was found dead a couple of months later).


I don’t believe that kids should be subjected to testing before the age of 15/16, it’s harmful, not helpful (YoungMinds, the youth branch of our Mind mental health charity, has seen a marked rise in mental illness in primary age kids, due to the feeling of inadequacy brought on by SATs). 


The average age for the commencement of compulsory education in Europe is 6.5, only the UK and Ireland believe it should start at 2.5/3, although some countries have voluntary ‘play schools’ for younger kids (in the Netherlands they’re extremely popular and always oversubscribed. I have a Dutch friend who went from working in an inner-London primary school (she couldn’t hack it “to teach in Britain you have to hate kids” she had kids hating her because our education system is anti-children and a 5-year-old doesn’t understand that it’s the system, and not their teacher, that’s to blame) to working at one of these ‘play schools’ (and I wish I could remember what the Dutch call them)) to being the head of a primary school in a small town near Amsterdam).


I’ve rambled again, haven’t I…? I’m sorry. Do my British rantings bother you…? Do I bore you? Want me to FOAD? Please tell me – I’m serious, I’m autistic and I honestly don’t know if I’m boring people unless I’m told.

You’re not, and don’t fret over it. One thing I have found here is that thanks to the wide range of ages and genders and nationalities and specialities and, well, everything else, when people speak on something they are knowledgeable and passionate about, it is ALWAYS interesting. And understanding how things are done elsewhere helps us understand ourselves and how we fit into the world with everyone else.

I was always vaguely aware the the British school system was flawed, but I had no idea it had gone so far down the ‘teach to the test’ road that turns education into rote memorisiation and makes kids incapable of dealing with the wholly dissimilar model they find in post-secondary education. What the hell happened? For centuries England was a place you found many of the world’s best scientists and philosophers and engineers. Where are they supposed to come from now?

I guess it’s in the old Soviet tradition of “Aren’t you glad you live here in Russia, where everything is awesome?” news stories.

I thought the only vegetables in Russia were the mistakes of Putin’s henchmen…if you want the hit done right…and so on.

Somebody should ask her about the Muslim refugees responsible for the St. Valentine’s Day massacre.

First Teen Vogue, now Cosmo: the future of actual journalism. I notice Chris Matthews didn’t question Kelly about Bowling Green Masacre. Maybe he thought she said mascara.

It seems like only yesterday that Donald was running for president, promising to do the exact same thing as Obama.














norcalOG








You have to like the quick leap to equivalency for Republicans. They’re very comfortable  going to the “Obama, Hillary, Bill Clinton, Reid did it too” card, which is surprising since they’ve long since established the moral and ethical bankruptcy of any  prominent Democrat. Apparently, ” no worse than” should not b confused with “no better than”.














Jen B of the Resistance








Obama is the worstest to ever have been ever and everything he did was awful! So that is why we are doing the same things he did!

As an aside, the site is working WAY BETTER on my Android tablet with the ads gone.  I had stopped visiting much because it was so frustratingly slow to load, impossible to (not) comment. I have to figure out now how to double my monthly pittance.

Was it really the “Bowling Green Massacre”, or even the “Bowling Green Kerfuffle”. I personally prefer the “Bowling Green Snit”.

a) the real Bowling Green Massacre only shows that we are, like we were when we let Tsarina Short Fingers’ mother in, still banning people from the wrong countries.


b) am I the only one who has come up with: 
Greeeeeen Massacres, it’s the place to be!
 can we make a whole go of this and do the whole song?














efoveks








a) You got that right, sister! Extra points for the insult. I’m stealing it too, btw.; and b) — Omg, what a groaner! Did I snort when I laughed about it? You bet I did! :)














Panika MCD








oh, when I get back from walking Calliope Jane, it’s on. we’re re-writing the whole song.






















uniquename72








It’s worth noting that there WAS a Bowling Green incident that can be summed up as follows: The FBI hatched a scheme to pretend to be terrorists and recruited 2 semi-retarded Muslims that they suspected of being “radicalized.” They then prosecuted these 2 “terrorists” for being involved in the FBI’s fake plot.


This is what passes for “terrorism” in Bush/Obama/Trump’s America.














SayItWithOtters








The Feebs are much better at creating their own terror plots that stopping actual terror plots.

I have no idea why the Donald keeps this woman around. He’s perfectly able to embarrass himself, he doesn’t need any help from her. 














efoveks








Every time one of Trump’s zoo blows a gasket or steps in it or just plain can’t take the heat, like Spicer or Penishead or that filth called Bannon, , they have ole Kellyanne to toss out as cannon fodder. As long as she’s willing to take the hits, they are willing throw her out there. Wait about ten years, when she writes her tell all. The “Bowling Green Massacre” (working title…) may be how she takes down all these idiots in her own camp who reeeeeeally pissed her off.














SatanicVagendaRebellion








It’s because she can look people dead in the eye, tell an absolutely bonkers lie and then take the reaction without flinching – that’s a rare skill.

Even Pence can’t help but wriggle a little bit when he forces out a really big whopper and the Drumpenfuhrer and Shadow President Gin Blossom just throw hysterically guilty-looking tantrums when challenged, those are bad optics.

I’m still convinced that somewhere in a vault there is a portrait of her getting steadily more attractive that Drumpf is holding for ransom. :P

CNN growing a spine?  Amazings if true!














Lambsendbeds








They had Bullshit Barbie on their teevee again already. *sigh* I was really hoping they WOULD grow a spine, but that’s just too much evolution to expect from them. 














phoenix00








So much for ‘speaking truth to power’ and all those pesky unprofitable moral things the media is supposed to do.














Freida Peeple








Bullshit Barbie…bless you for that






















Celtic_Gnome








Now, Evan, you know that wasn’t for us. That was for all the economically-anxious mouthbreathers who voted for Trump and will now fervently believe until the day they die that there was a terrorist attack in Bowling Green, Kentucky, that everyone refers to as the Bowling Green Massacre, and it was all Barack Hussein Obama’s fault, because he’s a secret Kenyan Muslin trying to destroy American from the inside.














Noun Verb








I just watched that interview in a rerun. OMFG I Pete’s a little laughing at that lunatic. She  actually said in response to Tapper’s question about why the White House omitted attacks by non Muslims like the Mosque attack in Canada..”Let me go on record as saying we are always sad about loss of life” 


Da Fuq! Like she just wrote their own get out of jail free card forever when they fail to care about white terrorists. Or to make excuses for creating false attacks.  


She didn’t seem to sad when we blew up a bunch of kids and got a SEAL killed so the DOD could show us a 9 year old video about the intel they got from the most recent raid gone wrong.  She was dancing for damn joy trying to blame Obama for an order Trump signed off on. 


Ahhh she makes blood come out of my ears!














guppy06








Uh oh, getting breaking news right now that the Harrisburg Dinosaur Fisticuffs are happening, with dinosaurs, in Harrisburg!


Well it’s about fucking time!  I was promised giant radioactive monsters in the wake of Three Mile Island, and yet it took 
how
 long for them to trample the state capitol in their rampage?!














Freida Peeple








If there really was a Bowling Green Massacre why didn’t republicans in congress have their usual “moment of silence”?


BTW : The very same people who believe there was a Bowling Green Massacre also claim that Sandy Hook never happened. Nice crowd huh
