This is the latest move in an impressive week from Gaga. Following her 
well-received Super Bowl halftime show
 on Sunday, she announced that she will 
tour arenas and stadiums
 all over the world behind her album 
Joanne
, which came out last October. Billboard 
predicts
 that 
Joanne
 will jump back into the Top 5 on the Billboard 200 next week as listeners scoop up copies following her Super Bowl performance.

Lady Gaga is a regular performer at the Grammys; she appeared at the ceremony last year to 
pay tribute to David Bowie
. Metallica hasn&apos;t been on the show since 2014, when they performed the song "One" with the 
classical pianist Lang Lang
.
Metallica&apos;s "Hardwired" is nominated for Best Rock Song this year. The band is competing with David Bowie, Radiohead, Twenty One Pilots and Highly Suspect. Gaga is not up for any awards as 
Joanne
 was released after the 2016 deadline.
Metallica and Gaga is one of several star pairings at the upcoming Grammys ceremony. Alicia Keys will also perform with country singer Maren Morris, while the Weeknd will reunite with 
Starboy
 collaborators Daft Punk.
