			There's a rumor about Episode 1 going around which would be funny if true.
		



			 
		






 
 
Reveal hidden contents







					Apparently the first 13 queens enter the workroom as normal, but they're joined by a 14th person, who is secretly Lady Gaga dressed up as a contestant. They all just think she's another queen until Ru comes in and reveals that it's actually Gaga and she's the guest judge for the episode.
				







			 
		



			Take it with a grain of salt, since it's not coming from a super reliable source, but I thought it might be worth mentioning. 
 
		







	Guess this is confirmed, then!
