Nancy Pelosi Blasts Steve Bannon As A 'White Supremacist'


"It’s a stunning thing, that a white supremacist would be a permanent member of the National Security Council.”

Nancy Pelosi was blunt Thursday when discussing White House strategist Steve Bannon, twice calling him a 
“white supremacist.”


The minority leader of the House of Representatives
 used that term to describe Bannon during a news conference, and didn’t mince words about his appointment to the 
National Security Council.


“It’s a stunning thing, that a white supremacist would be a permanent member of the National Security Council,” Pelosi said, adding that the appointment could impact national security itself.


“What’s making America less safe is to have a white supremacist named to the National Security Council as a permanent member while the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the d
irector
 of national intelligence are told, ‘Don’t call us, we’ll call you,’” she told reporters.


Before starting work for the Trump campaign, Bannon led Breitbart.com, a populist website that 
regularly airs white nationalist viewpoints
.


Although Bannon’s ex-wife 
accused him of making anti-Semitic remarks,
 he denied being a white nationalist to The Hollywood Reporter in November.


“I’m not a white nationalist, I’m a nationalist.
 I’m an economic nationalist,” he said, while comparing himself to Dick Cheney, Darth Vader and Satan.
