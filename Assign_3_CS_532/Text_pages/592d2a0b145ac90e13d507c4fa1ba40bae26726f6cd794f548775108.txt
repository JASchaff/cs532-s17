General Barry McCaffrey, now retired, appeared on MSNBC Live with Hallie Jackson to discuss Donald Trump’s jaw-dropping comments on Russian President Vladimir Putin.




JACKSON:
 MSNBC military analyst and 
retired four-star general Barry 
Mccaffrey, who is joining us 
here. 
General Mccaffrey, thank you for 
being here. 
President Trump's relationship 
with Vladimir Putin is really 
backing the headlines in a big 


way. 
You heard what he said about 
Putin and Bill O'Reilly's 
comments that Putin is a killer. 
How concerned are you about not 
just what the president is 
saying but the relationship that 
the U.S. Is going to have with 
Russia, where that's going to go 
from here? 




MCCAFFREY:
 Hallie, I'm actually 
incredulous that the president 
would make a statement like 
that. 
One could argue that's the most 
anti-american statement ever 
made by the president of the 
United States, to confuse 
American values with Putin, who 
is running a criminal oligarchy, 
who kills people abroad and at 
home, who imprisons journalists 
and takes away business 
property, who shares it with his 
former K.G.B. Agents, who 
invades and seizes crimea in 
eastern Ukraine, this is an 
astonishing state of affairs. 
It's hard to know what to think 
about it. 


JACKSON:
 You clearly have very strong 
feelings about this, general. 
But you just listened to Vice P
resident Pence defending him. 




MCCAFFREY:
 I'm glad I'm not vice 
president of the United States. 
The president is now headed to 
centcom. 
The troops he'll be visiting 
have been fighting to defend 
America to 15 years, we've had 
16,000 killed and wounded to try 
to protect this country. 
So for the president of the 
United States to talk about an 
equivalency between Putin and 
our killers is simply 
unbelievable to me. 




General McCaffrey is a man who 
knows what he's talking about:




Barry McCaffrey served in the United States Army for 32 years.  When he retired in 1996, he was the most decorated General serving in the United States Army, having been awarded 3 Purple Heart Medals for wounds received in combat, 
2 Distinguished Service Crosses (the nation’s second highest award for valor), and 2 Silver Stars for valor.
  He served overseas for more than 12 years ---and 4 combat tours with the 82nd Abn Division, the Vietnamese Airborne Division, the 1st Cavalry Division, and the 24th Mech Infantry Division.


FOR FIVE YEARS AFTER LEAVING THE MILITARY, GENERAL MCCAFFREY SERVED AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY (ONDCP).


Upon leaving government service, he served as the Bradley Distinguished Professor of International Security Studies from 2001-2005; and an Adjunct Professor of International Security Studies from 2006-2010 at the United States Military Academy at West Point, NY. He served as an Associate Professor in the Department of Social Sciences from 1973-1976 teaching American Government and Comparative Politics.
