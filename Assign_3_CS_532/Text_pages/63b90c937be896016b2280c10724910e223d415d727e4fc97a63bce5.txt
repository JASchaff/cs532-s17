After her 
epic Super Bowl Halftime Show
, and the announcement of her 
Joanne
 world tour, Lady Gaga is now sashaying into the workroom!


That’s right, Mother Monster is coming to 
RuPaul’s Drag Race
 as the special guest judge on the Season 9 premiere! What a way to kick things off!












Gaga 
tweeted out the announcement
 today which included a clip of Ru introducing the “Applause” diva to the Season 9 queens. Watch their reaction as they turn into a screaming pile of wigs and heels—can you blame them? 


“The season nine premiere event features a shocking opening that will go down as one of the most jaw-dropping moments in 
Drag Race
 history,” Logo said in a statement about Gaga’s RuVeal.


Little Monsters, how are we feeling about this 
fabulous
 news?












Check out the teaser below.
