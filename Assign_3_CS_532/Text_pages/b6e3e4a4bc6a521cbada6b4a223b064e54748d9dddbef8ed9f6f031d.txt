Betsy DeVos isn't the only Trump cabinet nominee who is facing a bumpy road to confirmation. Democrats stayed up 
all night
 to protest her nomination for education secretary because they are opposed to her plans to expand school choice and believe her confirmation hearings were "embarrassing" and exposed her lack of knowledge on the issues. Yet, even with the expected 50-50 tie, Vice President Mike Pence can cast the deciding vote to give her the job. 
 Labor Secretary nominee Andrew Puzder may need some help as well. The fast food executive was pressured to 
admit
 on Monday that he and his wife once hired a housekeeper who they did not know was an illegal immigrant. 
“My wife and I employed a housekeeper for a few years, during which I was unaware that she was not legally permitted to work in the U.S.,” Mr. Puzder said in a statement. “When I learned of her status, we immediately ended her employment and offered her assistance in getting legal status.”
After reporting the employee, Puzder said he and his wife paid back all the necessary taxes to the IRS and California. 
Democratic lawmakers who are trying to decide whether or not Puzder deserves their vote are also annoyed that he has failed to provide standard disclosures and questionnaires to the Senate committee that he will face at confirmation. 
The revelation about his undocumented housekeeper may not end his nomination, but it surely isn't going to speed up the already sloth-like confirmation process.
