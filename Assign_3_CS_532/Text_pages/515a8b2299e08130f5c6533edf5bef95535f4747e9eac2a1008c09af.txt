Attention SNL: Rosie O’Donnell Says She Is Available to Play Steve Bannon
Attention SNL: Rosie O’Donnell Says She Is Available to Play Steve Bannon

After word that 
Melissa McCarthy
‘s brilliant 
SNL
 turn as 
Press Secretary Sean Spicer
 “completely disturbed 
Trump
,” social media lit up with calls to have his nemesis 
Rosie O’Donell
 play 
Steve Bannon
 in upcoming episodes. SO BRILLIANT.


O’Donnell tweeted in response to a request from a Twitter follower: “available – if called i will serve !!!”




PLEEEEEEEASE,
 SNL
, it’s the opportunity of a lifetime. Let’s have 
Meryl Streep
 alternate with
 Alec Baldwin
 playing Trump (see below), and bring on Rosie, and you might singlehandedly drive the president to apoplexy.  (via 
Towleroad
)
