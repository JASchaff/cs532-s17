Construction continues on the Dakota Access Pipeline on Wednesday, Oct. 26, 2016, at Shirley Gerjets' farm in Rockwell City. Gerjets' farm has been with her family for decades, and she is deeply concerned about the pipeline running through her field, citing eminent domain and oil spillage among her chief concerns.

The companies behind the Dakota Access pipeline have reported thousands of gallons of oil spilled in dozens of industrial accidents over the last two years, according to an 
analysis 
performed by anti-pipeline environmental groups.
Pipeline parent company Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco, which recently announced a merger with Energy Transfer and will eventually operate the Dakota Access line, have, with their subsidiaries, reported discharges to the federal government of nearly 200,000 gallons of oil across 42 spills, the groups said Monday.
The Louisiana Bucket Brigade, which is fighting a 
sister pipeline to Dakota Access there
, together with Disastermap.net, studied 2015 and 2016 data from the National Response Center, the federal agency that tracks the discharge of oil, chemicals, and other pollutants into the environment.
Energy Transfer and Sunoco were involved in 69 incidents — including 35 pipeline accidents — over the two-year period, the analysis found. The accidents caused eight injuries and $300,000 in damage, the report found.
"It is a pretty sobering experience to go through these spreadsheets," said Anne Rolfes, founding director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, an environmental group. "To sift through all these pages really gives you an idea of the destruction."
Energy Transfer did not directly address the group's claims.
"Energy Transfer is committed to the safe construction and operation of all of its pipelines throughout the country," spokeswoman Lisa Dillinger said in a statement Monday. "Most importantly, safety is the companies' top priority — the safety of our people and our assets, the safety of all those who live and work in the communities through which we pass, and the safety of the environment."
The same goes for the Dakota Access pipeline, she said.
​"Dakota Access Pipeline is a state-of-the-art underground infrastructure project with advanced pipeline monitoring and control technology," Dillinger said. "Its design, construction, operation and maintenance will meet, and exceed where possible, all state and federal safety standards."
Craig Stevens, spokesman for the pro-pipeline Midwest Alliance for Infrastructure Now, said the nation's 2.6 million miles of pipelines remain the safest means of transporting oil and other energy products.
"These new pipelines are among the most technologically advanced ever constructed and exceed many state and federal guidelines," he said. "Most of those who oppose pipelines are enemies of fossil fuel — and their goal is to diminish U.S. energy development by attacking midstream delivery. If they’re successful, it will harm our nation’s economy, cost American jobs and make us less secure."
Still, the report likely will give further ammunition to groups fighting the 1,172-mile pipeline, which runs from the Bakken formation in North Dakota to a distribution hub in Patoka, Ill., cutting through 18 Iowa counties along the way.
The pipeline is all but completed save for a hotly contested stretch under the Missouri River in North Dakota.
President Donald Trump has 
pushed for completion 
of the project, a reversal of the previous administration. The crossing of the Missouri River awaits final approval from the U.S Army Corps of Engineers and could be further complicated by an ongoing federal lawsuit.

While pipeline proponents point to research showing pipelines are a safer and more affordable means of carrying oil than rail or truck, Rolfes says the recent data flies in the face of such arguments.
"This safety argument that they are peddling I think is really disingenuous," she said. "They know that that’s the public's concern so they’ve latched on to that. And yet none of the numbers bear that out."
Ezra Boyd, a geographer with 
DisasterMap.net
 who performed the research, said his work probably understates the number of incidents because it likely missed those attributed to some subsidiaries of Energy Transfer and Sunoco.
And many records in the federal database don't specify the amount of oil spilled.
But he said the available data raise serious questions about Energy Transfer and Sunoco, which between them recorded nearly three incidents per month in 2015 and 2016.
"What's a socially acceptable risk?" Boyd said. "If the airline industry had three accidents a month, people wouldn’t fly. If other industries had this high of a rate, it would be considered socially unacceptable risks. … For some reason, the oil and gas industry gets more leniency."
About half of the 69 documented incidents involved oil, gas and propane pipelines. Some spills were as small as one gallon, while others dumped thousands of barrels.
In September, an 
analysis by news agency Reuters
 found that Sunoco spilled crude more often than any of its competitors, with more than 200 leaks since 2010.
"The industry is not doing themselves any favors," said Tom Seng, applied assistant professor of energy business and assistant director of the School of Energy at The University of Tulsa.
Yet, he said pipelines remain the safest way to move oil across the country. And new pipelines that incorporate better technology should prove safer than even the existing infrastructure.
"It is my hope that as these new pipelines go in, perhaps we can retire some of these older ones that can spill and leak," he said.
Even the most in-depth analysis studying the number of incidents lacks context without factoring in the miles of pipeline or the amount of product each company transports (Energy Transfer operates some 
71,000 miles of pipeline
 carrying natural gas, natural gas liquids, crude oil and other refined products).
Most pipeline operators consciously make safety a top concern, Seng said.
"Let's face it: No real company wants a spill," Seng said. "Let's say they don't even care about people or the environment: They don’t want fines, they don’t want lawsuits, they don’t want tighter regulations."
He said environmental groups often miss the big picture when opposing individual infrastructure projects such as oil pipelines. Low oil prices have led to record sales of SUVs and trucks in recent years.
Renewable energy production fueled only about 10 percent of U.S. energy consumption in 2015, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. And Seng said consumer demand for fossil fuels shows no signs of slowing down.
"The reality is, if the demand is there, these projects are going to be built," Seng said. "Unless we curb our appetite for fossil fuels, we’re not going to see major change."
