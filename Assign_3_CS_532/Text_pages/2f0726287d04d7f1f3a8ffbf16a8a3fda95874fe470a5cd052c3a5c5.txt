Sean Spicer may have
 
laughed off
 
Melissa McCarthy's 
portrayal of him
 on
 
Saturday Night Live
, but the White House is in fact "rattled," reports
 
Politico
, noting "it was Spicer's portrayal by a woman that was most problematic in the president's eyes." As one President Trump donor puts it, "Trump doesn't like his people to look weak." 
{ "position1" : { "type" : "live", "id" : 6043, "name" : "NBC News Radio", "description" : "The news you want, when you want it" } }
Some say Trump's silence on the skit on Twitter suggests it hit a little too close to home. And though Spicer described it as "cute" and "funny," sources say he actually found it upsetting. But "it doesn't really matter what I think," Spicer tells Politico. "I would much rather have the focus be on the president's agenda and the success he's having. That's all I'm saying on it."
