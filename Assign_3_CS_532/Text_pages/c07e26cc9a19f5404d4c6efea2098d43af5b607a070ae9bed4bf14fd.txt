If there's one thing Donald Trump hates, it's 
Saturday Night Live. 
If there's a second thing, it's probably Rosie O'Donnell.


The two entertainers have 
feuded publicly and viciously
 for years, but given 
POTUS' alleged discomfort
 with seeing 
a woman portray one of his staffers
, O'Donnell may have a trump card ready (sorry). 


Social media wants to see O'Donnell on 
SNL
, and she's ready to suit up as "#BannonInChief."

Sean Spicer: Melissa McCarthy 'could dial back' impression


The idea to have O'Donnell portray Bannon as a guest star gained momentum on Twitter following the news that Trump is apparently very upset a woman (Melissa McCarthy) portrayed Sean Spicer. 


O'Donnell herself heard about the Twitter plan — and she's into it.

SNL
's Mikey Day is the show's resident Bannon impersonator (typically shown with a mask as the Grim Reaper) but might step aside for a night at this opportunity to anger Trump more than the show already does on a weekly basis. 


Vanity Fair
 noted
 that the show rarely crowdsources its casting — but 
Facebook did get Betty White
 to host in 2010, so we won't give up yet.


Alec Baldwin himself will host 
SNL
 this weekend, so Rosie or not, something Yuge is probably in the works. 


In the meantime, let's all rewatch that sketch that has the Trump administration so angry, shall we?
