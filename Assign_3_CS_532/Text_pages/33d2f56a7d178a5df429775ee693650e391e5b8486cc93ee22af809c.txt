Betsy DeVos has been confirmed as Secretary of Education in a historic tie-breaking vote by the Vice President. She was a controversial choice – she has no public education experience whose main qualification is that she was megadonor for Trump. She struggled in front of Senators and was asked 1,400 follow up questions after. Here are her best quotes:


1.
 DeVos Wants Guns in Schools “To protect against Grizzlies”


You can’t make this up.


2. 
DeVos doesn’t know the difference between proficiency and growth


Senator Al Franken asked about the relative advantage of assessing schools using proficiency over growth. DeVos replied with confusion:


“I think if I’m understanding your question correctly around proficiency. I would also correlate it to competency and mastery so that each student is measured according to the advancement that they’re making in each subject area.”


A surprised Franken replied, “Well, that’s growth. That’s not proficiency.” DeVos could not tell the difference between these two simple measures.


 


3. 
DeVos Argues She Would Have the Nomination Even If Her Family Hadn’t Donated $200,000,000 to Republicans


DeVos was asked about the role her family’s contributions had played in nomination by Senator Bernie Sanders. She replied:


“Senator, as a matter of fact, I do think that there would be that possibility. I’ve worked very hard on behalf of parents and children for the last almost 30 years to be a voice for students and to empower parents to make decisions on behalf of their children, primarily low-income children.”


4. She Doesn’t Know Whether She Will Continue Funding Public Schools


Although funding public schools which provide necessary education to the vast majority of children in the US seems important for the Secretary of Education, DeVos appeared uncertain about the topic.


Senator Patty Murray asked whether DeVos would be working for public or private schools as Secretary, and followed up to DeVos’s response with, “I take that as not being willing to commit to not privatizing public schools or cutting money from education”. DeVos was only able to waffle, “I guess I wouldn’t characterize it in that way”
