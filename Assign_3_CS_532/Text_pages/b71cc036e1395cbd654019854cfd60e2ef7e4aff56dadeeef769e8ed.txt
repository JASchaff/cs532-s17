Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to President Donald Trump, reportedly believes that the thousands of calls from constituents opposing Trump’s secretary of education nominee are not “real people.”


According to Capitol Hill staffers, citizens opposing Betsy DeVos’ nomination have flooded the Capitol Hill switchboard with a record 
1.5 million calls a day
. 


While the flood of calls may cause some senators to think twice before voting for DeVos, the White House is reportedly ignoring the outpouring. 


Politico 
reported
 that Conway dismissed the callers during a meeting with lawmakers on Monday. 


During Monday’s morning meeting, Conway, multiple sources said, shrugged off the concerns from thousands of people jamming phone lines critical of Trump’s Cabinet nominees, explaining that she’s more worried about her own “RPI” or “Real Person Impact” meter.














“She basically said the people jamming up the phones don’t matter to this White House,” one Republican senator’s communication director reportedly said. “That this administration just cares about what matters to ‘real people.'”


Conway told Fox News on Tuesday that DeVos would be confirmed, but she expected that Vice President Mike Pence would be needed to cast a tie-breaking vote.
