Rosie O'Donnell Says She's 'Available' to Play Steve Bannon on 
Saturday Night Live
Cady Lang

With 
Alec Baldwin playing Donald Trump
 and now 
Melissa McCarthy portraying White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer
, 
Saturday Night Live
 has landed some truly memorable celebrity cameos for their political sketches. If they're in the market for another high-profile comedic turn in the future, however, Rosie O'Donnell is volunteering as tribute.
Following 
a 
Politico 
report
 on the White House's alleged response to this week's 
SNL
 parodies, people on the internet started dreamcasting the White House roles, with one interesting idea: casting Rosie O'Donnell as Steve Bannon.
O'Donnell for her part, is ready and willing to step up to the role if duty calls. The actor, 
a long-time foe of Trump
, responded on Twitter to fans who suggested that she take on a Bannon parody on Monday, writing that she was "available — if called, I will serve!"
available - if called i will serve !!!

The actress later reminded fans that this was just an idea and that nothing was definite.

 - no - that's an alternate fact - someone tweeted it as an idea - after Melissa was so brilliant ... just a funny idea
