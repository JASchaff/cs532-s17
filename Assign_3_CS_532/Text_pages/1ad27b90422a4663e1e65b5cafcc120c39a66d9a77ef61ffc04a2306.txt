The Trump administration is sending in federal agents to clear out Dakota Access Pipeline protesters from the Standing Rock Sioux reservation 
reports
 The Washington Post.




Shortly after Trump became president he issued a presidential memorandum instructing the Army Corps of Engineers to expedite the review of the pipeline, after President Obama had blocked its construction. Now heâs making sure it gets done â and with force if necessary.

Several protesters have refused to leave the area, including a group of influential U.S. military veterans who are vowing that the pipeline âwill not get completed.â








âWe are committed to the people of Standing Rock, we are committed to nonviolence, and we will do everything within our power to ensure that the environment and human life are respected. That pipeline will not get completed. Not on our watch,â said Anthony Diggs, a spokesman for 
Veterans Stand
.


Currently, tribal officials are saying that they will fight any federal permit in court but havenât given any indication on how they will fight back if they are forcefully removed from the area by federal authorities.






Trump was asked a question about the Standing Rock Sioux tribe shortly after signing the executive order, and he completely ignored it. The look on his face indicated that he just really didnât care.




While some are claiming that the pipeline will serve as the safest way to transport oil, the Standing Rock tribe argues that it would travel through sacred burial grounds and wreck havocÂ on local water sources, violating a long-standing treaty achieved between the U.S. government and Indian tribes.


One possible solution to make both sides happy was a solution that the previous administration thought up under President Obama â they temporarily halted the construction in order to conduct a thorough environmental review to see if other routes would be a better option. Trump didnât agree with that assessment â he halted the review.


The agents being dispatched are Bureau of Indian Affairs agents â officers of the federal government who continually exercise law enforcement actions over the tribes.


Trump used to have a vested business interest in the construction of the pipeline but he reportedly sold his stake in Energy Transfer partners, the company overseeing its construction, last summer.


We will soon find out how ugly things get if enough protesters resist leaving the area.
