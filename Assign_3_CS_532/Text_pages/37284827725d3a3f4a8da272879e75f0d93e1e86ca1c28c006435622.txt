			If you haven't seen a Gaga tour in person before though, I highly suggest going to this one. It may be just Joanne songs but she always delivers quality with her tours so you're sure to have an AMAZING time as Gaga puts on another fantastic show.
		







	Which tour have you seen?

	Does anyone know roughly how much general admission is going to be? I cant find exact prices for anything. How they do this to peasants like me that need to count my coins to see if I can afford it.
