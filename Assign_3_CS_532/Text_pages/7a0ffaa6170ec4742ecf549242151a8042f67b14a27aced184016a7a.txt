Hold the Floor: Will Defiant Democrats Defeat DeVos Today?

Senate Democrats decided that Betsy DeVos’s nomination to become Secretary of Education is where they draw the line on President Trump’s nominees. Yesterday, Republicans scheduled a vote on the floor of the Senate, but it has been postponed by the Democratic senators’ continued testimony, as 
they promised to continue
 to hold up the vote for 24 hours.














Democrats spent the first of what may be several sleepless nights testifying against DeVos. Republican senate leadership responded to the Democrats’ action by committing to continuing the senate session until DeVos, Senator Jeff Sessions, Representative Tom Price, and Steven Mnuchin are confirmed.








The senators are just one vote short of defeating DeVos, thanks to senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who announced that they did not support her nomination last week. This would leave the tie-breaking vote in the hands of Vice President Mike Pence. Democrats hope that the additional time will give voters the time to pressure another Republican into breaking ranks. One more vote would end by defeating DeVos by a 51-49 vote.










 Senator Chuck Schumer of New York 
opened the debate
 with his argument for just that, saying “The American people are speaking in one loud voice against this nominee. I’ve had people come up to me in New York and say ‘I voted for Donald Trump, but I’m making calls about this nominee…’ We need just one more vote and we can get a lot better Secretary of Education than the one that was nominated.”
