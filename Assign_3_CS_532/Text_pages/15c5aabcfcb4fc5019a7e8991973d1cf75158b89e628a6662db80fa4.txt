        As the suggestion began circulating online, O'Donnell, who has publicly feuded with Trump since 2006, jokingly tweeted 'i would need a few days to prepare - so if called - i will be ready.'

Rosie O'Donnell is ready and raring to spoof senior White House adviser Steven Bannon on Saturday Night Live, picking up the gauntlet thrown on social media following last weekend's installment of the popular show, which has been irking the U.S. president so much.

There was curious silence from U.S. President Donald Trump on Twitter following last weekend's episode of SNL, a show that has regularly lampooned Trump and his associates, with Alec Baldwin in the starring role as the president. Trump has not been shy about tweeting criticism of the NBC show, but he has remained mum about last Saturday's installment.
That's even though it featured his press secretary, Sean Spicer, played by a woman - actress Melissa McCarthy - and despite the portrayal of top White House adviser Steve Bannon by a new cast member, Mikey Day, in full costume as the grim reaper.








“More than being lampooned as a press secretary who makes up facts,” 
a source told the Politico website
, “it was Spicer’s portrayal by a woman that was most problematic in the president’s eyes.”

 - i am here to serve - alec has trump - melissa has spice - i would need a few days to prepare - so if called - i will be ready
— ROSIE (@Rosie) 
February 7, 2017






With that in mind,
 a Hollywood writer for the Vanity Fair website suggested 
that, Rosie O'Donnell, the television personality, actress and comedienne who has had a decade-long hostile relationship with Trump, could put Trump over the edge if she were to play Bannon.
"The nastiest, gendered feud of Trump’s career (if you don’t count the 2016 election) is the public battle he’s fought with Rosie O’Donnell. Starting in 2006 (when O’Donnell made disparaging remarks about the future president on 'The View'), Trump told People, 'Rosie's a loser. A real loser. I look forward to taking lots of money from my nice fat little Rosie,'" noted Vanity Fair's Johanna Robinson, who also noted that "Trump had made it clear that he has certain expectations when it comes to gender," Vanity Fair's Johanna Robinson wrote.




As Robinson sees it: "It seems unlikely that SNL will tap O’Donnell for the part. The show doesn’t often cast its roles by committee. But for O’Donnell—a plus-sized, gay woman—to step into the role of the power behind Trump’s throne might just be the thing to send the president over the edge. (If that’s their goal.)"
As the perhaps facetious suggestion began circulating following last weekend's installment of Saturday Night Live that Rosie O'Donnell would be the perfect choice to play senior White House adviser Steve Bannon, the idea ultimately reached O'Donnell herself, who tweeted: "i am here to serve - alec has trump - melissa has spice - i would need a few days to prepare - so if called - i will be ready."
