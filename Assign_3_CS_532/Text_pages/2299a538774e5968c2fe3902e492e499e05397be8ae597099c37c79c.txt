Ohio elected officials may face charges if illegal immigrant kills someone

Columbus




Taking a hard line against refugees and illegal immigrants, Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel and state Rep. Candice Keller, R-Middletown, are pushing new legislation that could impose criminal and civil sanctions on city officials that declare their cities “sanctuary cities.”












Elected officials could face criminal sanctions and civil lawsuits if an illegal immigrant kills or injures someone, according to Keller’s bill. The bill, as discussed by Mandel and Keller in a press call Monday morning, would also outlaw cities from declaring themselves sanctuaries.






TAKE OUR POLL:
 Do you think Ohio elected officials should be punished for actions of illegal immigrants?






Lawmakers in Alaska, Colorado and Maine are advocating similar bills to crackdown cities that refuse to enforce federal immigration laws — though Keller did say the bill, when introduced either on Thursday or Friday, likely would not hold elected officials criminally liable.




Mandel’s office drafted the press release and “executive summary” on what this legislation could contain.




Mandel, who announced in December that he is running for U.S. Senate again, offered as justification for the new bill crimes committed across the country by illegal immigrants and incidents of terrorism around the globe with ties to “radical Islam.”






EARLIER STORY: Judge who stops Trump’s order has local ties














“I believe that sanctuary cities are an out of touch, misguided policy that snubs their nose at our nation’s laws and undermines the security of our communities. Whether it is radical Islam or other threats, sanctuary cities will only empower our enemies, not deter them,” Mandel said Monday.




Cincinnati, Columbus and Dayton all have policies that prohibit local law enforcement resources being used to take action against people based on immigration status alone. Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley and Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther, both Democrats, recently declared their cities “sanctuary” cities — a term that is loosely defined.




Other cities in the area such as Springfield, have not taken any action on becoming a sanctuary city.






Dayton launched Welcome Dayton program in 2011






Dayton launched its Welcome Dayton program in 2011 in an effort to encourage immigrants to move to the city and help boost population. Toni Bankston, city of Dayton spokeswoman, said: “We don’t consider ourselves a sanctuary city. We haven’t seen any legislation and until we do we can’t really make any comment.”

In a prepared statement, Cranley, a Democrat, said Mandel is continuing to “lie” about the city of Cincinnati and said the proposed legislation is simpley “a straw man for his political ambitions.”




“We have not and will not violate federal laws,” Cranley said. “We are standing with refugees and disagreeing with President Trump’s executive orders, which is our First Amendment right to do. Mandel’s attempt to jail people who disagree with the President is an outrageous attack on the First Amendment.”




Immigration is a hot political flash point. President Donald Trump signed an executive order that aimed to tighten internal enforcement of U.S. immigration law, including the defunding of so-called “sanctuary cities,” that harbor illegal immigrants as well as increase internal enforcement of existing immigration law. And protests erupted nationwide after the president signed an order imposing a temporary ban on citizens of seven predominately Muslim countries — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — entering the United States.






Sex assault, diseases also a problem, state lawmaker says






Keller said in researching the issue, she found there are 8,000 illegal immigrants with criminal histories living in sanctuary cities.




“A lot of the culture and a lot of what we’re seeing come in includes not only terrorism and crime but sexual assault, sexually transmitted diseases, child marriage, child rape prosecution. Six states have already reported rape and sexual assault. Refugees many times say this is sanctioned in their culture and religion and that they simply don’t wish to assimilate into our culture,” Keller said. “And further, the diseases. We now have 11 active tuberculosis cases in Ohio, what was once a controlled disease. It is costing $150,000 per case to treat and it takes six months to a year.”

RELATED: What are sanctuary cities and where are they?






Keller did not offer details on which cultures accept child exploitation.




She continued, “Refugee resettlement, contrary to what we hear in the mainstream media, is not about humanitarianism.” Instead, most refugees are on some government welfare and there are government-supported financial incentives for companies to hire them, she said.




“We see them see them working in food processing and meat packing. They’re in manufacturing and the hotel industry. So the employers are enjoying cheap labor at the expense of us,” Keller said.




Mandel, who is Jewish, frequently talks of his grandparents, who escaped extermination at the hands of Nazis.




Mandel said comparisons between Muslim refugees today and Holocaust victims last century aren’t fair. He said today radicals are embedded with refugees as a way of sneaking into the U.S.

Mandel, who is Jewish, frequently talks of his grandparents, who escaped 




Nazis weren’t embedded with Jewish refugees seeking safety, he said.




But, according to Smithsonian.com, the U.S. State Department, FBI and President Franklin D. Roosevelt claimed that Jewish refugees could pose a serious threat to national security and stories of Nazi spies entering the U.S. as refugees made headlines.




In November, Mandel, a Marine veteran who served two tours in Iraq, declared the car and knife attack on Ohio State University’s campus to be the work of radical Islamic terrorism.




FBI Special Agent in Charge Angela Byers, however, said federal authorities are still not ready to tie the attack by OSU student Abdul Razak Ali Artan to the Islamic State, though Artan may have been “inspired” by Anwar al-Awlaki, an al Qaeda leader.




“Right out of the box it’s misguided, it’s counter-productive, and it is potentially unconstitutional in more than one way. And it shows an alarming lack of knowledge regarding how immigration enforcement works,” said Gary Daniels, lobbyist for the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio.
