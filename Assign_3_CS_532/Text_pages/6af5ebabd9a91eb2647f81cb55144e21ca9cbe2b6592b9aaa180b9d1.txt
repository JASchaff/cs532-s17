Metallica said they had something “
very unique and special
” in the works for their performance at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards and apparently they weren’t lying! A fan posted what appears a new commercial announcing that the world’s biggest metal band is set to hit the stage with one of the world’s biggest pop stars, Lady Gaga.


The news comes off the heels of Gaga’s thrilling halftime performance at the Super Bowl and these two acts might possibly be the hottest items on the touring market as of right now.


The Twitter post here shows a commercial clip with the announcement, which has since been confirmed by 
Rolling Stone
.


Lady Gaga is set to perform with Metallica at the 
#GRAMMYs
 this Sunday, February 12th!

With the performance just a few days away, hopefully Metallica frontman 
James Hetfield
 will have fully recovered from the ailments which have 
forced the postponement
 of the band’s Copenhagen shows. The singer powered his way through a Feb. 3 show, admittedly struggling with vocal issues, even 
asking the crowd if the band should stop
 and come back another night to deliver the standard quality performance.


Metallica will also be playing a show at the Hollywood Palladium directly after the conclusion of the Grammys, which airs Feb. 12 at 8PM ET on CBS.


The collaboration should come as no surprise as Lady Gaga is a known metalhead, openly praising the likes of greats like 
Black Sabbath
, 
Iron Maiden
 and 
Judas Priest
. In August of 2015, she even said she’d 
rather be the next Maiden
 than the next Madonna.
