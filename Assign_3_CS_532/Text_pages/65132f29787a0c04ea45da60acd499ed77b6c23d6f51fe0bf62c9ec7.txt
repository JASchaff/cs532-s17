We're Bald: Lady Gaga to Make a Cameo in New Season of 
RuPaul's Drag Race








 






Don't be a drag, just be a queen.

Just a week after 
the cast of 
RuPaul's Drag Race 
season 9
 
was announced
, something really insane happened that will forever change the cultural landscape of American television: Lady Gaga announced she'll be appearing on the show's upcoming season. Just see for yourself:






 




...and now @ladygaga is on to the Gay Super Bowl!! . We're absolutely gagging!!!! Come through Gaga and welcome to #DragRace finally!! 


A video posted by RuPaul's Drag Race (@rupaulsdragrace) on 
Feb 7, 2017 at 9:59am PST
 






We can only assume this means Mother Monster will serve as a guest judge, though if TV producers hear our 
sinner's prayer
 then she'll get really involved and do, say, an underwater music video with the queens?

Gaga is really putting her nose to the grindstone these days: don't forget, she just rocked the 
Super Bowl
, announced a 
World Tour
, and secured a duet alongside Metallica at the Grammys. And to think we were proud of ourselves for not hitting snooze more than twice this morning...
