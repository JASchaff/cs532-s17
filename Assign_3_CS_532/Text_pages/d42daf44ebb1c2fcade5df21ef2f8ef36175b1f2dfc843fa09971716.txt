Of course Senator Harris (a Democrat from CA) is referring to the fake news around Betsy DeVos and grizzly bears. That being said, clearly the senator has never actually seen or interacted with a grizzly, otherwise she wouldn‚Äôt say something so stupid.

Then again, she is a Democrat.

Why do Democrats hate capable, energetic, competent women?

Because Democrats believe women need them to succeed. The idea of an independent woman who thinks for herself is a threat to their narrative so if and when a woman is an outspoken and successful conservative, they become a target.

Dime a dozen.

@thehill
 
Anyone who makes this sort of ridiculous statement about 
#devos
 has received campaign donations from teachers Unions.

Sorta like her buddy, Senator Patty Murray, who has also been screeching about DeVos and who¬†reportedly took over $100k from the American Federation of Teachers. Yup.

Unions over kids, it‚Äôs actually pretty disgusting.

Dude, let‚Äôs not give Harris any ideas.

@thehill
 Says the Senator 
@KamalaHarris
 whose state has had schools destroyed by teachers unions & flooded with illegal aliens

Right? Forget that she‚Äôs clearly out of her gourd, look at the condition of education in her own state. Why on Earth should anyone listen to her?

@thehill
 
@KamalaHarris
