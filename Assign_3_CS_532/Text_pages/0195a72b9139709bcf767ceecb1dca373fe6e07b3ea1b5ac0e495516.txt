Lady Gaga performs during the Pepsi Zero Sugar Super Bowl 51 Halftime Show at NRG Stadium on Feb. 5, 2017 in Houston. 
















Lady Gaga
âs 
Joanne
 album is on course for a big jump on next weekâs 
Billboard 200
 chart, according to industry forecasters. Sources suggest the former No. 1 set could vault back into the top five, and possibly to No. 2, following Gagaâs halftime performance on the Super Bowl (Feb. 5).
Prognosticators suggest 
Joanne
 could earn over 70,000 units in the week ending Feb. 9 -- up from the 8,000 it scored in the frame ending Feb. 2 (according to Nielsen Music). On the latest Billboard 200 chart (dated Feb. 18, reflecting the Feb. 2-ending tracking week), 
Joanne
 slid 59-66.
The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week based on 
multi-metric consumption
, which includes traditional album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). The top 10 of the new Feb. 25, 2017-dated Billboard 200 chart -- where 
Joanne
 could zoom to No. 2 -- is scheduled to be revealed on 
Billboard
âs websites on Sunday, Feb. 12.






During the halftime show, Gaga performed a number of her most familiar hits, alongside a new song, âMillion Reasons,â from 
Joanne
. The album was released last October, and debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, granting Gaga her fourth chart-topping set.
It was earlier 
reported
 that 
Joanne
 surged in digital sales on the day of the Super Bowl, racking up over 12,000 downloads sold that day (up 1,077 percent). Overall, based on initial sales reports collected for Sunday 
according to Nielsen Music
, the diva sold about 150,000 digital albums and songs in the U.S. on Feb. 5 -- an increase of a little more than 1,000 percent compared to the previous day, when she sold around 15,000 digital albums and songs.
