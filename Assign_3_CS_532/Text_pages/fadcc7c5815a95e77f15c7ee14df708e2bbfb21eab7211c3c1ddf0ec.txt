										Immigrant Dads Smash Stereotypes And Embrace Their Queer Kids In “El Canto del Colibrí”						





			"I was not afraid for myself. I was afraid he would be rejected."

In the short documentary 
El Canto del Colibrí
  (“The Hummingbird’s Song”), immigrant Latino fathers share stories about their children coming out.


“You’re Mexican, and they don’t accept their gay children,” says one of the dads of the expectations of his community.  Instead, he chose to embrace his son, telling him, “You’re my son and I love you just the way you are.”

Not all of the stories begin with acceptance, though: One father says that, after watching his gay brother get bullied growing up, he desperately feared what that life would be like for his son. Another recalled the violence directed at queer people in his community, as he hoped his daughter would keep her sexual identity under wraps.

Their children, now adults, recount the difficult conversations they had with their parents—and share what it’s meant to eventually find love and acceptance. 


“It’s been a beautiful process with my dad,” says one woman, “because we’ve gotten to talk about things that I’d never imagined being able to talk about.”

The fathers come from a variety of class and ethnic backgrounds: Some are undocumented migrant workers, some survived homelessness and substance abuse, while others had stable middle-class upbringings. These intimate conversations explore the intersectionality of LGBT issues with immigration, class, culture. 


For some of the men, their experiences with discrimination as immigrants helped them to connect with the intolerance their LGBT children face.

These stories are especially poignant, as Donald Trump escalates his efforts to build a wall along the Mexican border. Violence against Latinos 
is on the rise in some parts of the U.S. 
 since Trump 
declared Mexican immigrants are “bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.”
.


“
El Canto del Colibrí
 is my humble attempt to show that Latino immigrant men are not all like the picture we have been fed in this society: 
machista, homofóbico, y transfóbico
, and certainly not godfather to a queer person,” director Marco Castro-Bojorquez told 
Remezcla
. “That premise is racist.”


Instead, he hopes to portray a different image of his community. “I want to show that there are Latino immigrant fathers who love their LGBT children unconditionally, and that they reaffirm their love as they share their experiences with us, and that their journey wasn’t easy.”


Castro-Bojorquez, named a White House Champion of Change in 2015, also directed 
“Tres Gotas de Agua,”
 (“Three Drops of Water”) in which three Latina moms shared stories about their kids’ coming out. 


He dedicated 
Colibrí
 to his own father, who died while he was finishing the film. 


“I want people to watch this film and reflect—talk with others and to change their hearts and minds. I want to bring real hope to the community that is the target of insults on a daily basis from a country we love and we call home. We are not going anywhere!”


El Canto del Colibrí

			I believe that true, well-told stories have the power to change the world for good. I also love a good listicle.
