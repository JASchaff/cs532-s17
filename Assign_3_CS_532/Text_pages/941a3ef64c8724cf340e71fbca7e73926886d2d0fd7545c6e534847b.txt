BuzzFeed News Reporter






























































Top Chef
 alum Mark Simmons recently added a little FYI message to the bottom of his New York restaurant‚Äôs receipts in response to President Donald Trump‚Äôs travel ban.






Breakfast in Brooklyn

‚ÄúImmigrants make America great (they also cooked your food and served you today),‚Äù the statement reads.
Journalist Mary Emily O‚ÄôHara noticed the note as she was paying for breakfast this past weekend. She posted the receipt on Twitter, where it‚Äôs been shared more than 80,000 times.

Simmons, who moved to the US from New Zealand, 
told 
DNAinfo
 that workers at Kiwiana restaurant come from five different countries and Trump‚Äôs controversial comments and actions undercut the core of the restaurant industry.
‚ÄúI added that message to the bottom of the receipts recently, to remind ourselves [and] our customers that immigrants are quite often the backbone of the hospitality industry,‚Äù he said.
While the pro-immigrant dig at Trump has garnered mostly positive feedback, his brunch prices are another story.






Several Twitter users balked at O‚ÄôHara‚Äôs $46 brunch tab, wanting to know ‚ÄúWhy the hell is French toast $13?‚Äù

But she defended the restaurant and chalked it up to a solid boozy brunch (cue: Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol).






@MaryEmilyOHara for everyone freaking out about the prices, it's mostly bc alcohol. The portions are good, sides come with. Normal for NYC.

‚Ä¶and good old New York.






Who are these people who think $13 for a brunch plate is insane? Where do you live and how much rent do you pay? And can I move in?
