Lady Gaga performs during the Super Bowl 51 halftime show in Houston.

Lady Gaga is the latest artist to prove that a spectacular Super Bowl performance can mean big digital sales.
Her 
Super Bowl 2017 halftime show
 sparked sales of approximately 150,000 digital albums and songs in the US on Sunday, 
according to Billboard
. She sold around 15,000 digital albums and songs on Feb. 4 by comparison. The performance featured a medley of her hits, including "Just Dance," "Poker Face" and "Born This Way."
"Million Reasons" from Gaga's latest full album, "Joanne," was the big seller with more than 45,000 downloads Sunday. "Joanne" was her biggest selling digital album for the day, too, coming in at more than 12,000.
Super Bowl 2016 halftime 
performances by the band Coldplay and artists Bruno Mars and Beyonce
 boosted sales for all three acts. Beyonce's performance at Super Bowl 2013 had a similar effect on her sales as well as those of her group Destiny's Child, which reunited for the show. For the week following Super Bowl 2013, their combined album sales were 28,000, a 40 percent rise. Song download sales for Beyonce and Destiny's Child hit 280,000, up nearly 70 percent, 
according to Billboard
.
