			Quacinella: For Italian Americans, immigrant ban is personal

Dad had a long and beautiful life, to the ripe old age of 92, and it breaks my heart every day to know he is gone from this earth. But his timing was always good.  He came to his beloved America shortly after World War II, from Sicily, when people were starving throughout Italy and cities were in ruins.

He would’ve been furious about the current White House occupant’s treatment of immigrants and refugees. Syrians fleeing a brutal war to be turned away from the United States, period, end of discussion?  Walls and raids instead of real solutions for undocumented workers? He would’ve wanted everyone to stand against such desecration of the Constitution.


For Italian Americans, this is personal, and not only because so many are either immigrants themselves or the first or second generation born in the United States, with deep ties to the immigrant experience of parents or grandparents who passed through Ellis Island.


It’s also because of the little known forced relocation of more than 10,000 Americans of Italian descent along the California coast away from their homes and livelihoods from late 1941 to 1943— 2,000 from Pittsburg in Contra Costa County alone.  Within a two-week period in mid-February 1942, four elderly Italian men in the Bay Area and Stockton committed suicide.


Another 52,000 Italian Americans nationwide were subjected to strict curfews.  The 600,000 residents of Italian descent the government classified as “enemy aliens” had to register, get fingerprinted, and carry government booklets at all times.  The FBI raided homes without warrants, looking for anything “subversive,” made arrests, sent innocent people to interment camps for years.  Then, as now, the reasons were political, with the public whipped into a frenzy of fear.


Unbelievable?  Check out professor Stephen Fox’s important 1990 book, “The Unknown Internment: An Oral History of the Relocation of Italian Americans during World War II.”  Government documents finally declassified in 1997 fill in many of the details.


Or visit Missoula, Mont.  In addition to craft beer and a river, there you’ll find a sprawling prison where 1,200 Italians were deprived of their liberty from 1941 to 1944.  Their “crime”?  Working at the World’s Fair in Chicago or as sailors on an Italian cruise ship seized in the Panama Canal.  Visit the immigration court where these men were tried—not a single one was found to pose any threat to the United States or its people, yet all were detained for years.  More than 1,000 Japanese men were also interned at Fort Missoula for questioning before being transferred to other camps.  More than 110,000 Japanese Americans were interned nationwide, the ultimate scapegoats in a race-obsessed society.


 


Legislation by San Jose Rep. Zoe Lofgren, HR 4146 and HR 4174, to apologize and educate about the Italian Americans’ history, sponsored by San Jose’s Chet Campanella, whose uncle was arrested and interned, has long been stalled in the Republican-controlled House. What was done to Italian, German and Japanese citizens and residents should have never happened under our Constitution. It must never be allowed to happen again.
