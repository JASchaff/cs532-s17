Emergency DeVos Tweet Sheet















Betsy DeVos vote is TODAY.  Right now the vote stands at 50-50 if all senators vote as they say they will.  That makes Mike Pence the tie-breaker, and you know how he will vote!!
Tweet these Republican senators to urge them to vote NO!  First two are Republican senators up for re-election in 2018 in blue/swing states (NV and AZ), and the rest are supposedly not 100% sure of their vote for DeVos....who knows, but it's worth a try!






Tweet: .@JeffFlake, for the love of American children, vote NO on the ridiculously unqualified Betsy DeVos!! #swingstate #2018

Betsy DeVos is not qualified and should never have been nominated. Do what's right for our children and grandchildren's futures.

Say NO to DeVos......because you want your name to go down on the right side of history....and you know that this is a pivotal moment wherein you reveal your true colors and concern for the future of America.

Every single child in America should be well educated. That means the physically disabled child who may be a savant at math or science. That means a child in a rural school who has only a public school to enable him or her a pathway to self-sufficiency as an adult. An educational system shall NOT be the personal honeypot of greedy politicians!!!!!

If we turn our system of education over to profit, we lose our foundation, the thing which actually made this the greatest country on earth. We cannot remain a player on the world stage if our children become pawns in a capitalistic pursuit of profit. Ms. Devoss has a proven record of implementing education systems that have no accountability & are created solely for profit. Ms. Devoss has zero knowledge or training for this cabinet position. Do not be on the wrong side of history. Yield not to the temptation of greed. Vote NO on Devoss

 My grandsons deserve an education that is not ruled by someone as ignorant as Betsy DeVoss. I am from CT and the fact that this woman feels guns should be in a school to protect the children from a grizzly bear...come on..  Does she live in a shoe and not know what is happening in our schools.

Urging all Senators to vote no on Betsy DeVoss. She is unqualified, with too many conflicts of interest, to hold such an important position. Protect the integrity of the public school system.

DeVos is not qualified to lead this department.  For-profit schools have proven to be failures.  Please do not approve this woman for this position.  (40 year veteran of both public and private schools)

Are you listening to the people that put you in office or are you doing your own thing. Vote no!! You want your educators to be highly qualified, then the person that leads them needs to be highly qualified

thank you, did all these clowns today. Can't the GOP see what a disaster this really stupid woman would be for the public education system -- it needs help and funding, not someone to destroy it.
