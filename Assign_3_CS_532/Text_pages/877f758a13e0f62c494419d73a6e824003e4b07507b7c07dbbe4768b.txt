GOP Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) spent the night supporting Education Secretary nominee Betsy DeVos ahead of a major vote on Tuesday.


DeVos was confirmed in a senate vote at noon Tuesday.  


“I believe she will help to improve public education,”  Scott said. “For too many of our children a quality public education … is simply not happening.”


Democrats held an all-nighter Monday, ahead of the vote which ended up as a 50-50 tie. 
Vice President Mike Pence cast the historic, tie-breaking vote
.




“I am seriously concerned about our debate on Betsy DeVos and I’m seriously concerned about public education,” Scott said Monday night. “Far too often we forget to have a debate about the children in the system.”


School choice is one of the main topics of debate when it comes to DeVos.


On Tuesday, Scott said everyone needs to move forward and realize she can’t make sweeping changes on her own.


“She’s not going to be able to mandate school choice,” he said. “That will be our decision.”
