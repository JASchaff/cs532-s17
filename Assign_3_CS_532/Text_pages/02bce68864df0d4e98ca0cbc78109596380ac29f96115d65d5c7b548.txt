Politics
Rosie O'Donnell Wants to Play Steve Bannon on 
SNL

This article originally appeared on 
EW.com
.


Rosie O’Donnell is ready to take on Steve Bannon.


In a series of tweets on Monday night, the comedienne nominated herself to play Donald Trump’s controversial chief strategist on 
Saturday Night Live
 after the president was reportedly 
“rattled”
 over Melissa McCarthy’s depiction of his press secretary.


Though McCarthy’s 
acerbic portrayal of Sean Spicer
 on Saturday’s 
SNL
 had the 
White House press secretary calling it
 “funny,” Trump was apparently less amused. 
Politico
 reported the president was particularly irked that Spicer looked “weak” in the sketch and was portrayed by a woman — which led many on Twitter to suggest an 
SNL
 appearance by Trump’s longtime foe, O’Donnell.


The former talk show host seems game.


“#BannoninChief,” O’Donnell wrote on Twitter. Later, she posted, “available – if called I will serve!!!”

The feud between Trump and O’Donnell goes back more than a decade. O’Donnell 
criticized Trump
 as “snake-oil salesman on 
Little House On The Prairie
” during a 2006 episode of 
The View
. Trump responded by calling her “a woman out of control.” More recently, Trump insulted O’Donnell during several 
Republican
 
debates
 when he was running for president.

On the current season of 
SNL
, Bannon is being portrayed as the Grim Reaper. During last weekend’s episode, a sketch featuring Alec Baldwin’s version of Trump ended with Grim Reaper Bannon pushing the president off to the side to reclaim his seat as leader of the free world. Baldwin’s Trump was left to play with a children’s toy. (The actual Trump, a vocal critic of 
SNL
 and Baldwin’s impersonation, did not comment via Twitter on the sketch.)
