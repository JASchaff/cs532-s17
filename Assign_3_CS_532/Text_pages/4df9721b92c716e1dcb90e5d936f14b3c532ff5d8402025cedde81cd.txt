Mike Pence Casts A Historic Tiebreaking Vote To Confirm Betsy DeVos As Education Secretary

BREAKING: VP Mike Pence casts historic tie-breaking vote to confirm Betsy DeVos as Pres. Trump’s education secretary 
https://t.co/HxFJAzYvbx

— CNN (@CNN) 
February 7, 2017


On Tuesday, Betsy DeVos was 
officially confirmed as Secretary of Education
 after Vice President Mike Pence cast a tie-breaking Senate vote. It was a historic vote, as it was the first time a cabinet approval needed the vice president to break a tie, and two Republicans crossed party lines to vote against her.


DeVos’ eventual confirmation had a rocky road, as many questioned her credentials heading into the Senate vote. She didn’t instill much confidence in her qualifications, as she had trouble addressing standard education policies during her confirmation hearing and is an infamous proponent of charter schools. And let us not forget her support of guns in schools, which she illustrated by using the example of a 
school being attacked by bears
. In addition, she also may have 
plagiarized some answers
 to a Senate questionnaire, so her tenure is not off to a solid start.


Despite half of the Senate’s reservations and an all-night filibuster, the final vote came down to a 50-50 vote tie. It should be noted Republicans held a 52-48 majority in the Senate, but 
two Republicans
 (Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski) crossed party lines to vote against DeVos. Per the constitution, Pence was brought in to break the tie and voted in her favor. DeVos’ confirmation brings up more questions regarding 
Donald Trump’s cabinet appointments
, as qualifications of some are still being challenged.

Hang on, I’m just seeing it on TV now so I’ll have to find the story to link.  Talking about how the voucher program will eliminate access for at-risk kids and suicides will sky rocket.  Someone actually said “this is not an exaggeration”.  Fucking seriously…

Profile












By: ColeND28 






02.07.2017 @ 2:13 PM












I’ll cop to being a liberal who thinks Betsy DeVos is going to result in a kid getting killed.  She wants teachers to be able to have guns in schools.  The amount of accidental shooting deaths by children in this country seems to make it obvious to me that having guns in schools dramatically increases the likelihood of a kid getting shot.
























Profile












By: Upon Further Review 






02.07.2017 @ 2:16 PM












@ColeND28 see, THAT is a legitimate claim to the safety of kids in school.  I can’t even imagine some of my former teachers having a damn gun in the classroom and hitting anything but students.


@ImBateman yea, my niece has attempted suicide.

02.07.2017 @ 2:26 PM












So you have family that is at-risk, yet you don’t find it at all troubling?
























Profile












By: Upon Further Review 






02.07.2017 @ 3:23 PM












No, because it’s not going to eliminate access for at risk kids.  People just want to fear monger every little thing they can instead of chewing up the actual substance we have against DeVos.  


She’s an awful pick for education secretary, and is troubling for our public education system, but suicide rates are not going to skyrocket unless there’s some self-fulfilling prophecy occurring here.


Kids are probably pressured more by the ridiculousness of Common Core and complete lack of support they have from both educators and parents with that system than anything vouchers could maybe hypothetically do.

02.07.2017 @ 4:23 PM












@Upon Further Review – pulling money away from public schools and putting it towards voucher programs i.e. private & charter schools, will affect at-risk student before most of their peers, as those programs would likely get cut prior to others when schools start missing the funds they previously got…

this hurts rural portions of red states the worst. Selecting and paying for school is meaningless if there only one choice and the voucher is based on income. It just means less funding for what they already have or keep the money and home school.
























Profile












By: ColeND28 






02.07.2017 @ 2:15 PM












That’s exactly what they want.  Make the public school system completely not viable so everyone has to go to their local church school or homeschool where they can be kept safe from the evils of evolution.

Couple this with the fcc getting rid of discounted internet and it makes virtual and home schooling not an option. The majority depend on federal dollars to remain solvent. Tax revenues dont produce enough to fund the government.

Yes in the end we all lose. Having a generation of home schooled children taught by their idiot parents, will not bode well for the nation as a whole.

At the very least, Republicans can no longer claim that qualifications for government jobs matter.  Only 2 of them had the balls to stand up and say no (and one of those 2, Susan Collins, has been called a RINO for about a decade).

Many of the problems our education system is facing is because of Republican policies.  (ex. no child left behind).  You can easily do 10 minutes of research to find out A) why this lady is fucking horrible for public education and B) why republicans want to destroy public education.  HINT:  A and B are similar.
























Profile












By: Staubachlvr 






02.07.2017 @ 3:48 PM












A) Yes no child left behind was an abomination that made education worse but it was going downhill before that, when democrats had the white house, and it didn’t get better during Obama, so both parties have let it go to shit 


B) her voucher program isn’t a bad idea but her “guns to protect against grizzly bears” is legit insane


I wasn’t defending her, just pointing out that our education system is already a dumpster fire

The public education in my state (minus Milwaukee) is really pretty good.  That’s the problem with “leave it up to the states” thinking on shit as important as education.   Some states are going to value education greatly and treat it accordingly.  Some are not and it’s just going to further divide this country and make the poor folks poorer.  DeVos wants segregation laws to be a state decided thing.  I think we’ve already shown, both through Southern states explicit segregation and Northern states de facto segregation that the states cannot be trusted keep the best interests of minority students in mind.


As far as vouchers, there are good arguments for and against vouchers (I personally disagree with them, but my brother who has been a teacher his whole life and votes straight ticket democrat is in support of them).  Vouchers work pretty good in countries like Hong Kong and Sweden that don’t have a strong religious tradition .  Unfortunately, the US has religion and education inextricably co-mingled. Until we can ensure that religious schools aren’t teaching their children anti-science lies, I’d like to do my best to make sure we don’t funnel public money into supporting religious indoctrination and leaving the education of our most vulnerable citizens up to people who think schools should be run to make a profit.

Some 44 states have either a GOP controlled legislature, a GOP governor, or both. States will not counterbalance, they will pave the path to public schools destruction or (best case) their re-segregation.
























Profile












By: Staubachlvr 






02.07.2017 @ 4:23 PM












I agree 100% on the religious aspect of the education. And you do make a valid point about states and segregation.  The problem with that is that schools are more segregated than most people think because schools are divided by county. The wealthy can afford to move to wealthier school districts, and the poor are stuck in their shitty ones. So while I don’t want to see segregation, it’s already happening and leaving millions of students, many of which are minority, behind. I’m open to all kinds of ideas on education simply because what we’re doing isn’t working. 


She’s an awful selection for many reasons but her main opposition, the teachers union, is just as awful, because they’re fighting to keep the status quo and all that’s doing is horse fucking children
