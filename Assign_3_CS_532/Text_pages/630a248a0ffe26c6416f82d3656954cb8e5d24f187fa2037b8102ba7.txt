President Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of labor has given his opponents new fodder to use against him, admitting he once employed an undocumented immigrant.


Business executive Andrew Puzder
, whose nomination has been stalled while he navigates the process of divesting himself of his extensive business interests, blew the whistle on himself.


“My wife and I employed a 
housekeeper
 for a few years, during which I was unaware that she was not legally permitted to work in the U.S.,” Puzder said in a statement Monday night. “When I learned of her status, we immediately ended her employment and offered her assistance in getting legal status.”

“We have fully paid back taxes to the IRS and the state of California and submitted all required paperwork,” he continued.


Puzder, the chief executive of CKE Restaurants, which operates the Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s chains, has not yet completed the ethics review required for him to be considered by the Senate for confirmation. This has prompted Democrats to attack his nomination.


“It’s long past time for Mr. Puzder to deliver on his commitment to file paperwork with the Senate and let the American people know what issues are causing so many headaches for the Trump administration,” Karl Frisch, executive director of Allied Progress, said Monday.

The 
Washington Post
, however, reported that the federal ethics office is reviewing Puzder’s paperwork and that a hearing could be scheduled as soon as next week.


Puzder is 
opposed
 by labor unions and liberal groups over his opposition to raising the minimum wage. He has also attacked an Obama-era rule that sought to expand eligibility for overtime pay.


Although some of Puzder’s critics have called upon him to withdraw even before this latest disclosure, both Puzder and the White House have indicated that’s not in their plans.

“Andy Puzder has no intention of withdrawing. He’s looking forward to a successful hearing and being the next secretary of labor,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said Monday night.


Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said Puzder’s 
disclosure
 is not automatically fatal to his nomination.


“Based upon what I’ve learned, since Mr. Puzder reported his mistake and voluntarily corrected it, I do not believe that this should disqualify him from being a Cabinet secretary,” he said.


However, that has not always been the case. In 2001, Linda Chavez had to withdraw from being labor secretary under former President George W. Bush over the same issue. In 1993, former President Bill Clinton’s attorney general nominee, Zoe Baird, suffered the same fate after having hired undocumented household workers.
