						  Petition by 
						  
Judith LeBlanc




To be delivered to  



Mr. Gib Owen, Water Resources Policy and Legislation, Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works








Petition Statement


Do not allow President Trump to circumvent the environmental impact study being conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers. Respect the sovereign, legal, and moral right of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to protect water for their tribe and the 17 million people who live and work along the shore of the Missouri River. 







	There are currently 35,731 signatures.
		

NEW goal - 
We need 40,000 signatures!
		






















Petition Background




  
   President Trump's recent executive actions to push through the pipeline projects of the TransCanada Keystone XL pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline is a violation of Standing Rock Sioux Tribal sovereignty and marks the beginning of a full-frontal attack on Mother Earth on behalf of the fossil fuel industry.



It's crucial we make our opposition heard.



The Department of Army is now accepting public comments as part of the environmental impact statement for the Lake Oahe crossing by the proposed Dakota Access Pipelineâand we have until February 20 to submit our comments in opposition to this pipeline. Sign the petition now to submit your comment.



President Trump's executive actions violate the legal and moral sovereign treaty rights of the Lakota, Nakota, and Dakota people and is an aggressive rebuke of more than 300 tribes who stand with Standing Rock in opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline.



With the strength of prayers and people power, water protectorsâNative and non-Nativeâacross the country are more than ready to respond with sustained actions to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline and the Keystone XL Pipeline.



Native Organizers Alliance will continue to support the tribal, spiritual, and grassroots-led movement which has mobilized millions to stand with Standing Rock. 



Stand with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and water protectors. Sign now to submit your comment.
