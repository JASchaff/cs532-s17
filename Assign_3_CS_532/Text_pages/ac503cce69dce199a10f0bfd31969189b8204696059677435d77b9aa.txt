Yet Another Instance Surfaces of Kellyanne Conway Citing ‘Bowling Green Attack’

A third instance has emerged in which White House counselor 
Kellyanne Conway
 referred to a terrorist attack in Bowling Green, Kentucky that never actually occurred.


Conway first came under fire when citing the “Bowling Green massacre” in a Thursday interview with MSNBC’s 
Chris Matthews
. Conway responded by claiming 
she simply “misspoke” and attacking the “haters”
 in the media for not giving her the benefit of the doubt.


That talking point 
suffered a blow
 when 
Cosmopolitan
 revealed Monday that Conway had also referenced the “Bowling Green massacre” in an interview with them four days earlier. Now, 
The Daily Beast reports
 that they dug up another instance of Conway using the false talking point.


“President Obama suspended the Iraq refugee program for six months in 2011 and no one certainly covered—I think nobody noticed,” Conway told TMZ January 29. “He did that because, I assume, there were two Iraqis who came here, got radicalized, joined ISIS, and then were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green attack on our brave soldiers.”
