'We won't forget': Pa. protesters say Toomey's DeVos vote ignored will of constituents

PITTSBURGH -- It was roughly 30 minutes into Tuesday's protest outside Sen. Pat Toomey's riverside office building here when news broke of Betsy DeVos' narrow senate confirmation.


Amid a wave of fresh notifications hitting the smart phones of those in the crowd was also confirmation that Toomey (R-PA) had backed the embattled education secretary pick, something this crowd and others across the state had spent weeks urging him not to do, but largely expected he would.  


"We won't forget," the Pittsburgh crowd shouted in response as similar protests took place outside Toomey's offices elsewhere in the state, including Philadelphia.  


Toomey blames excessive office calls, emails on 'people outside of our state' ahead of DeVos vote


But for many in the Pittsburgh group, at least, Toomey's DeVos vote had been a foregone conclusion, and Tuesday's demonstration outside his Station Square office building more about expressing opposition to those future appointments currently awaiting the senate's approval. They include labor secretary pick 
Andrew Puzder
, and Trump's picks for environmental cabinet positions.


"He [Toomey] has already said he's for her [DeVos]. He thinks she's the best candidate, and he doesn't listen to any of his constituents here," Mary Rahuba, a former public school teacher, said roughly 40 minutes before Tuesday's senate vote.  


"So I expect him to support her. And then we go into conference with a tie vote, essentially, and then we're going to have [Vice President] Mike Pence break the tie and she'll be nominated."


In the end, that's exactly 
how it played out
, a fact which stoked fresh outrage with protesters incensed over what they feel is an unchecked executive branch, the inability of Democrats in congress to stop it, and the unwillingness of some Republicans to do the same.   


"Education is very important. We've been in it for 30-plus years and I'm worried," Rahuba added of DeVos' confirmation before Leslie Evans, another former public school teacher, chimed in.


Opponents of Betsy DeVos pony up dollars to try to buy Pat Toomey's vote


"She's going to suck all the money for public schools into private schools," Evans said of DeVos. Others argue that DeVos alone can't defund public education, but would require congressional backing through the 
appropriations process
 to do so. 


Still, DeVos' confirmation had been vociferously opposed by teacher's unions and public school advocates, with critics often counting DeVos' past advocacy for school choice and her own private school upbringing as strikes against her.  


Much of that opposition has also been directed at Toomey, with a weeks-long torrent of phone calls, emails and faxes inundating his offices around the state and in the nation's capital. Toomey's critics have also continued to assail his accessibility during that time, claiming he's done little to engage a sizable portion of his constituency. But Toomey's office says he's been anything but aloof, and that he's made every attempt to speak with critics amid the growing clamor of the last month.   


To that end, Toomey's Pittsburgh staff again briefly met with a contingent of protesters inside his office building here on Tuesday, as they have done in weeks past. The "Tuesdays with Toomey" protests have become a weekly event, both here and in other cities across the state.


But Richard Granger, a Pittsburgh labor leader, said Tuesday's conversation was again unfruitful. Granger also said staff told him that Toomey's Pittsburgh office would be relocating within the city, although they didn't say when or where. In an email to PennLive, Toomey's communications director said: "The Senator's staff in Pittsburgh has been looking for new office space for several months. No plans have been finalized yet. IF any change is made, the office will still be located in downtown [Pittsburgh]." 


'I want him to have a spine': Desperate Trump critics turn up the pressure on Sen. Pat Toomey


Meanwhile, protesters like Steven O'hearn of Tarentum said they'd continue the weekly protests outside Toomey's office, wherever it is, even in lieu of any favorable response from the senator.


"This is the long game. This is a long-term investment," O'hearn explained. "[We will be here weekly] and get even more unpleasant or more colorful or some other word."  


UPDATE: This article has been updated to include comment from Toomey's staff about the possible relocation of his Pittsburgh office.
