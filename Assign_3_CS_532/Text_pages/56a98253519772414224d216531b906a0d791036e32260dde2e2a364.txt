Could 
Donald Trump
’s most famous enemy wind up being “Saturday Night Live‘s” most inspired casting choice yet?


Following reports that the president was “rattled” by 
Melissa McCarthy’s portrayal of White House press secretary Sean Spicer
, 
Rosie O’Donnell
 is throwing her hat in the ring, offering to portray chief strategist Steve Bannon.


In a series of tweets Monday night, O’Donnell appeared enthusiastic about the idea of popping up on SNL, insisting that she was “available” to serve alongside 
Alec Baldwin
’s Donald Trump and McCarthy’s Spicer “if called” to appear on the late-night sketch program.








available – if called i will serve !!!

Though Trump has not publicly commented on McCarthy’s performance, 
Politico
 on Monday reported that the president took offense with Spicer being portrayed by a woman, with one Trump donor asserting that POTUS “doesn’t like his people to look weak.” The article also suggests that the sketch isn’t doing Spicer any favors, whose longevity as press secretary is already being called into question given his struggles to develop a working relationship with the press.

Thus far, Bannon has been depicted on SNL as the grim reaper, with many speculating that the man behind the mask is cast member Mikey Day, who can be seen wearing dark eye makeup in McCarthy’s behind-the-scenes 
Instagram post
.


Politico’s report comes after Spicer himself 
weighed in
 on McCarthy’s SNL spoof, telling Extra
 
that his portrayer “could dial back” some aspects of her performance, joking that the comedienne “needs to slow down on the gum chewing.”


Whether or not O’Donnell gets the call, one thing’s for certain: Baldwin will once again step into the role of Trump on Feb. 11 when he serves as host of SNL for a record-setting 17th time.
