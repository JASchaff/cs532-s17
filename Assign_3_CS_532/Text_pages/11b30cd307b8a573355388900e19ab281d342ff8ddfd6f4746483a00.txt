Gentleman, start your engines, and may the best woman, win! 


That‚Äôs the catchphrase Emmy Award-winning drag queen and TV host RuPaul uses season after season on 
RuPaul‚Äôs Drag Race
. And that‚Äôs exactly what 
Lady Gaga
 is set to soon repeat.


Yes, Mother Monster has 
finally 
agreed to appear as a guest judge on Logo‚Äôs hit comedic show and the preview proves that the songstress contains charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent‚Äîthe four traits RuPaul looks for in ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Next Drag Superstar.‚Äù On Tuesday, the team behind the show cleverly made the announcement by responding to one of Gaga‚Äôs tweets from 2013.


Back then, she wrote, ‚ÄúCan I PLEASE be a judge on drag race! @RuPaul I started out in these club, these women taught me how to serve!‚Äù Four years later, RuPaul‚Äôs team replied and wrote, ‚ÄúWish finally granted Mother Monster.‚Äù

In the preview clip below, Gaga basically makes every gay boy‚Äôs ultimate dream come true and stands next to RuPaul dressed in a look that gives Season 9‚Äôs contestants a serious run for their money.
